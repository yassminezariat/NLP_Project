They sleep for 18-22 hours a day and eat 500 grams of eucalyptus leaves every day. Koalas have strong arms, powerful legs, and sharp claws. The biggest threat to koalas is habitat loss due to human activity, including cutting down large chunks of forests.

To conserve koalas, it is important to care for them, especially those that are sick, lost or injured, and nurse them back to health.
