task of pushing his charette all the way to Louvain But to stay to look after Patrasche never entered his thoughts the beast was dying and useless and he would steal to replace him the first large dog

damit zu machen als plÃÂ¶tzlich ein weiÃÂes Kaninchen mit rothen Augen dicht an ihr vorbeirannte Dies war grade nicht sehr merkwÃÂ¼rdig Alice fand es auch nicht sehr auÃÂerordentlich daÃÂ sie das Kaninchen sagen hÃÂ¶rte O weh o weh Ich werde zu spÃÂ¤t kommen Als sie es spÃÂ¤ter wieder ÃÂ¼berlegte fiel ihr ein daÃÂ sie sich darÃÂ¼ber hÃÂ¤tte wundern sollen doch zur Zeit kam es ihr Alles ganz natÃÂ¼rlich vor Aber als das Kaninchen seine Uhr aus der Westentasche zog nach der Zeit sah und eilig fortlief sprang Alice auf denn es war ihr doch noch nie vorgekommen ein Kaninchen mit einer Westentasche und eine Uhr darin zu sehen Vor Neugierde brennend rannte sie ihm nach ÃÂ¼ber den Grasplatz und kam noch zur rechten Zeit um es in ein groÃÂes Loch unter der Hecke schlÃÂ¼pfen

zu schieben Nun dachte Alice bei sich nach einem solchen Fall werde ich mir nichts daraus machen wenn ich die Treppe hinunter stolpere Wie muthig sie mich zu Haus finden werden Ich wÃÂ¼rde nicht viel Redens machen wenn ich selbst von der Dachspitze hinunter fiele Was sehr wahrscheinlich war Hinunter hinunter hinunter Wollte denn der Fall nie endigen Wie viele Meilen ich wohl jetzt gefallen bin sagte sie laut Ich muÃÂ ungefÃÂ¤hr am Mittelpunkt der Erde sein LaÃÂ sehen das wÃÂ¤ren achthundert und funfzig Meilen glaube ich denn ihr mÃÂ¼ÃÂt wissen Alice hatte dergleichen in der Schule

da war das Kaninchen nicht mehr zu sehen Sie befand sich in einem langen niedrigen Corridor der durch eine Reihe Lampen erleuchtet war die von der Decke herabhingen Zu beiden Seiten des Corridors

was not going to do that in a hurry No Ill look first she said and see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later However this bottle was not marked poison so Alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up like a telescope And so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle I wonder what I should be like then And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing After a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried Come theres no use in crying like that said Alice to herself rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute She generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people But its no use now thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people Why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants Well Ill eat it said Alice and if it makes me grow larger I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep under the door so either way Ill get into the garden and I dont care which happens She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself Which way Which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake>,)>,)"

the roof There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when Alice had been all round it and tried them all she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out

were around at the time he came in for a share but if he were not he had to wait until Mr Harrisons next hungry spell John Henry mournfully averred that he would have starved to death if it wasnt that

"(<Sentence: I HAVE been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind An old Greek writer mentions a people who lived there and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer and drowned themselves My story is not the same as his I do not think Herodotus had got the right account of the place I am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there He lived in a low room over a coachhouse and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind as his mother very well knew For one side of the room was built only of boards and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind And then let them settle between them which was the sharper I know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind Still this room was not very cold except when the north wind blew stronger than usual the room I have to do with now was always cold except in summer when the sun took the matter into his own hands Indeed I am not sure whether I ought to call it a room at all for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses And when little Diamondbut stop I must tell you that his father who was a coachman had named him after a favourite horse and his mother had had no objectionwhen little Diamond then lay there in bed he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark or moving sleepily in their dreams For Diamonds father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it because they had so little room in their own end over the coachhouse and Diamonds father put old Diamond in the stall under the bed because he was a quiet horse and did not go to sleep standing but lay down like a reasonable creature But although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature yet when young Diamond woke in the middle of the night and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind he could not help wondering whether if the wind should blow the house down and he were to fall through into the manger old Diamond mightnt eat him up before he knew him in his nightgown And although old Diamond was very quiet all night long yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake and then young Diamond knew what oclock it was or at least what was to be done next which wasto go to sleep again as fast as he could There was hay at his feet and hay at his head piled up in great trusses to the very roof Indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings which looked as if it had been sawn out for him that he could reach his bed at all For the stock of hay was of course always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow Sometimes the whole space of the loft with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed sometimes a yellow wall of sweetsmelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard Sometimes when his mother had undressed him in her room and told him to trot to bed by himself he would creep into the heart of the hay and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind and how warm it was inside there in his bed and how he could go to it when he pleased only he wouldnt just yet he would get a little colder first And ever as he grew colder his bed would grow warmer till at last he would scramble out of the hay shoot like an arrow into his bed cover himself up and snuggle down thinking what a happy boy he was He had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall and blew about him all night For the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick and on the other side of them was the north wind Now as I have already said these boards were soft and crumbly To be sure they were tarred on the outside yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber Hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it little Diamond found one night after he lay down that a knot had come out of one of them and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion Now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right so he jumped out of bed again got a little strike of hay twisted it up folded it in the middle and having thus made it into a cork stuck it into the hole in the wall But the wind began to blow loud and angrily and as Diamond was falling asleep out blew his cork and hit him on the nose just hard enough to wake him up quite and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole He searched for his haycork found it stuck it in harder and was just dropping off once more when pop with an angry whistle behind it the cork struck him again this time on the cheek Up he rose once more made a fresh stopple of hay and corked the hole severely But he was hardly down again beforepop it came on his forehead He gave it up drew the clothes above his head and was soon fast asleep Although the next day was very stormy Diamond forgot all about the hole for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mothers fire with a broken chair a threelegged stool and a blanket and then

turned sharp round to make for the road but it was too late the dogs were upon her with their wild cries we heard one shriek and that was the end of her One of the huntsmen rode up and whipped off the dogs who would soon have torn her to pieces He held her up by the leg torn and bleeding and all the gentlemen seemed well pleased As for me I was so astonished that I did not at first see what was going on by the brook but when I did look there was a sad sight two fine horses were down one was struggling in the stream and the other was groaning on the grass One of the riders was getting out of the water covered with mud the other lay quite still His neck is broke said my mother And serve him right too said one of the colts I thought the same but my mother did not join with us Well no she said you must not say that but though I am an old horse and have seen and heard a great deal I never yet could make out why men are so fond of this sport they often hurt themselves often spoil good horses and tear up the fields and all for a hare or a fox or a stag that they could get more easily some other way but we are only horses and dont know While my mother was saying this we stood and looked on Many of the riders had gone to the young man but my master who had been watching what was going on was the first to raise him His head fell back and his arms hung down and every one looked

you and Ludovic get married Theodora laughed comfortably Thats the question Grafton folks have been asking for quite a while I reckon Anne Well Id have no objection to marrying Ludovic Thats frank enough for you isnt it But its not easy to marry a man unless he asks you And Ludovic has never asked me Is he too shy persisted Anne Since Theodora was in the mood she meant to sift this puzzling

over itlike old Alder Speed who was always talking of going to England to see his brother but never went though there was no earthly reason why he shouldnt Theyre not lazy you know but they love to take their time And Ludovic is just an aggravated case of Speedism suggested Anne Exactly He never hurried in his life Why he has been thinking for the last six years of getting his house painted He talks it over with me every little while and picks out the colour and there the matter stays Hes fond of me and he means to ask me to have him sometime The only question iswill the time ever come Why dont you hurry him up asked Anne impatiently Theodora went back to her stitches with another laugh If Ludovic could be hurried up Im not the one to do it Im too shy It sounds ridiculous to hear a woman of my age and inches say that but it is true Of course I know its the only way any Speed ever did make out to get married For instance theres a cousin of mine married to Ludovics brother I dont say she proposed to him out and out but mind you Anne it wasnt far from it I couldnt do anything like that I DID try once When I realized that I was getting sere and mellow and all the girls of my

battered hat Kim found it easier to slip into Hindu or Mohammedan garb when engaged on certain businesses One of the young men of fashionhe who was found dead at the bottom of a well on the night of the earthquakehad once given him a complete suit of Hindu kit the costume of a lowcaste street boy and Kim stored it in a secret place under some baulks in Nila Rams timberyard beyond the Punjab High Court where the fragrant deodar logs lie seasoning after they have driven down the Ravi When there was business or frolic afoot Kim would use his properties returning at dawn to the veranda all tired out from shouting at the heels of a marriage procession or yelling at a Hindu festival Sometimes there was food in the house more often there was not and then Kim went out again to eat with his native friends As he drummed his heels against ZamZammah he turned now and again from his kingofthecastle game with little Chota Lal and Abdullah the sweetmeatsellers son to make a rude remark to the native policeman on guard over rows of shoes at the Museum door The big Punjabi grinned tolerantly he knew Kim of old So did the watercarrier sluicing water on the dry road from his goatskin bag So did Jawahir Singh the Museum carpenter bent over new packingcases So did everybody in sight except the peasants from the country hurrying up to the Wonder House to view the things that men made in their own province and elsewhere The Museum was given up to Indian arts and manufactures and anybody who sought wisdom could ask the Curator to explain Off Off Let me up cried Abdullah climbing up

horseblanketing and not one fold of it could Kim refer to any known trade or profession At his belt hung a long openwork iron pencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear On his head was a gigantic sort of tamoshanter His face was yellow and wrinkled like that of Fook Shing the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar His eyes turned up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx Who is that said Kim to his companions Perhaps it is a man said Abdullah finger in mouth staring Without doubt returned Kim but he is no man of India that I have ever seen A priest perhaps said Chota Lal

was in one of his fits of petulance that he sent him off to travel in America he thought he would send him away for a while so that he should not be made angry by constantly contrasting him with his brothers who were at that time giving him a great deal of trouble by their wild ways But after about six months he began to feel lonely and longed in secret to see his son again so he wrote to Captain Cedric and ordered him home The letter he wrote crossed on its way a letter the Captain had just written to his father telling of his love for the pretty American girl and of his intended marriage and when the Earl received that letter he was furiously angry Bad as his temper was he had never given way to it in his life as he gave way to it when he read the Captains letter His valet who was in the room when it came thought his lordship would have a fit of apoplexy he was so wild with anger For an hour he raged like a tiger and then he sat down and wrote to his son and ordered him never to come near his old home nor to write to his father or brothers again He told him he might live as he pleased and die where he pleased that he should be cut off from his family forever and that he need never expect help from his father as long as he lived The Captain was very sad when he read the letter he was very fond of England and he dearly loved the beautiful home where he had been born he had even loved his illtempered old father and had sympathized with him in his disappointments but he knew he need expect no kindness from him in the future At first he scarcely knew what to do he had not been brought up to work and had no business experience but he had courage and plenty of determination So he sold his commission in the English army and after some trouble found a situation in New York and married The change from his old life in England was very great but he was young and happy and he hoped that hard work would do great things for him in the future He had a small house on a quiet street and his little boy was born there and everything was so gay and cheerful in a simple way that he was never sorry for a moment that he had married the rich old ladys pretty companion just because she was so sweet and he loved her and she loved him She was very sweet indeed and her little boy was like both her and his father Though he was born in so quiet and cheap a little home it seemed as if there never had been a more fortunate baby In the first place he was always well and so he never gave any one trouble in the second place he had so sweet a temper and ways so charming that he was a pleasure to every one and in the third place he was so beautiful to look at that he was quite a picture Instead of being a baldheaded baby he started in life with a quantity of soft fine goldcolored hair which curled up at the ends and went into loose rings by the time he was six months old he had big brown eyes and long eyelashes and a darling little face he had so strong a back and such splendid sturdy legs that at nine months he learned suddenly to walk his manners were so good for a baby that it was delightful to make his acquaintance He seemed to feel that every one was his friend and when any one spoke to him when he was in his carriage in the street he would give the stranger one sweet serious look with the brown eyes and then follow it with a lovely friendly smile and the consequence was that there was not a person in the neighborhood of the quiet street where he livedeven to the groceryman at the corner who was considered the crossest creature alivewho was not pleased

skirt and a big white hat set back on his curly yellow hair he was so handsome and strong and rosy that he attracted every ones attention and his nurse would come home and tell his mamma stories of the ladies who had stopped their carriages to look at and speak to him and of how pleased they were when he talked to them in his cheerful little way as if he had known them always His greatest charm was this cheerful fearless quaint little way of making friends with people I think it arose from his having a very confiding nature and a kind little heart that sympathized with every one and wished to make every one as comfortable as he liked to be himself It made him very quick to understand the feelings of those about him Perhaps this had grown on him too because he had lived so much with his father and mother who were always loving and considerate and tender and wellbred He had never heard an unkind or uncourteous word spoken at home he had always been loved and caressed and treated tenderly and so his childish soul was full of kindness and innocent warm feeling He had always heard his mamma called by pretty loving names and so he used them himself when he spoke to her he had always seen that his papa watched over her and took great care of her and so he learned too to be careful of her So when he knew his papa would come back no more and saw how very sad his mamma was there gradually came into his kind little heart the thought that he must do what he could to make her happy He was not much more than a baby but that thought was in his mind whenever he climbed upon her knee and kissed her and put his curly head on her neck and when he brought his toys and picturebooks to show her and when he curled up quietly by her side as she used to lie on the sofa He was not

afternoon he came hurrying back and Granny knew by the way that he cocked his ears and carried his tail that he had news of some kind Well what is it she demanded I found a dead fish that had been washed ashore replied Reddy It wasnt big enough for two so I ate it Anything else asked Granny Noo replied Reddy slowly that is nothing that will do us any good Quacker the Wild Duck was swimming about out in the open water but though I watched and watched he never once came ashore Ha exclaimed Granny That is good news I think well go Duck hunting>, <Sentence: Granny And Reddy Fox Go Hunting When youre in doubt what course is right The thing to do is just sit tight Old Granny Fox Jolly round bright Mr Sun had just got well started on his daily climb up in the blue blue sky that morning when he spied two figures trotting across the snowcovered Green Meadows one behind the other They were trotting along quite as if they had made up their minds just where they were going They had You see they were Granny and Reddy Fox and they were bound for the Big River at the place where the water ran too swiftly to freeze The day before Reddy had discovered Quacker the Wild Duck swimming about there and now they were on their way to try to catch him Granny led the way and Reddy meekly followed her To tell the truth Reddy hadnt the least idea that they would have a chance to catch Quacker because Quacker kept out in the water where he was as safe from them as if they were a thousand miles away The only reason that Reddy had willingly started with Granny was the hope that he might find a dead fish washed up on the shore as he had the day before Granny certainly is growing foolish in her old age thought Reddy as he trotted along behind her I told her that Quacker never once came ashore all the time I watched yesterday I dont believe he ever comes ashore and if she knows anything at all she ought to know that she cant catch him out there in the water Granny used to be smart enough when she was young I guess but she certainly is losing her mind now Its a pity a great pity I can just imagine how Quacker will laugh at her I have to laugh myself He did laugh but you may be sure he took great pains that Granny should not see him laughing Whenever she looked around he was as sober as could be In fact he appeared to be quite as eager as if he felt sure they would catch Quacker Now old Granny Fox is very wise in the ways of the Great World and if Reddy could have known what was going on in her mind as she led the way to the Big River he might not have felt quite so sure of his own smartness Granny was doing some quiet laughing herself He thinks Im old and foolish and dont know what Im about the young scamp thought she He thinks he has learned all there is to learn It isnt the least use in the world to try to tell him anything When young folks feel the way he does it is a waste of time to talk to them He has got to be shown There is nothing like experience to take the conceit out of these youngsters Now conceit is the feeling that you know more than any one else Perhaps you do Then again perhaps you dont So sometimes it is best not to be too sure of

afraid that Reddy was planning to be saucy People who think themselves smart are quite apt to be saucy Presently they came to the bank of the Big River Old Granny Fox told Reddy to sit still while she crept up behind some bushes where she could peek out over the Big River He grinned as he watched her He was still grinning when she tiptoed back He expected to see her face long with disappointment Instead she looked very much pleased Quacker is there said she and I think he will make us a very good dinner Creep up behind those bushes and see for yourself then come back here and tell me what you think wed better do to get him So Reddy stole up behind the bushes and this time it was Granny who grinned as she watched As he crept along Reddy wondered if it could be that for once Quacker had come ashore Granny seemed so sure they could catch him that this must be the case But when he peeped through the hushes there was Quacker way out in the middle of the open water just where he had been the day before>, <Sentence: Reddy Is Sure Granny Has Lost Her Senses Perhaps tis just as well that we Cant see ourselves as others see Old Granny Fox Just as I thought muttered Reddy Fox as he peeped through the bushes on the bank of the Big River and saw Quacker swimming about in the water where it ran too swiftly to freeze Weve got just as much chance of catching him as I have of jumping over the moon Thats what Ill tell Granny He crept back carefully so as not to be seen by Quacker and when he had reached the place where Granny was waiting for him his face wore a very impudent look Well said Granny Fox what shall we do to catch him Learn to swim like a fish and fly like a bird replied Reddy in such a saucy tone that Granny had hard work to keep from boxing his ears You mean that you think he cant be caught said she quietly I dont think anything about it I know he cant snapped Reddy Not by us anyway he added I suppose you wouldnt even try retorted Granny Im old enough to know when Im wasting my time replied Reddy with a toss of his head In other words you think Im a silly old Fox who has lost her>)","(<Sentence: (<Sentence: tomorrow Much against his will Reddy obeyed It isnt the least bit of use he grumbled as he trotted towards the Big River There wont be anything there It is just a waste of time Late that afternoon he came hurrying back and Granny knew by the way that he cocked his ears and carried his tail that he had news of some kind Well what is it she demanded I found a dead fish that had been washed ashore replied Reddy It wasnt big enough for two so I ate it Anything else asked Granny Noo replied Reddy slowly that is nothing that will do us any good Quacker the Wild Duck was swimming about out in the open water but though I watched and watched he never once came ashore Ha exclaimed Granny That is good news I think well go Duck hunting>, <Sentence: Granny And Reddy Fox Go Hunting When youre in doubt what course is right The thing to do is just sit tight Old Granny Fox Jolly round bright Mr Sun had just got well started on his daily climb up in the blue blue sky that morning when he spied two figures trotting across the snowcovered Green Meadows one behind the other They were trotting along quite as if they had made up their minds just where they were going They had You see they were Granny and Reddy Fox and they were bound for the Big River at the place where the water ran too swiftly to freeze The day before Reddy had discovered Quacker the Wild Duck swimming about there and now they were on their way to try to catch him Granny led the way and Reddy meekly followed her To tell the truth Reddy hadnt the least idea that they would have a chance to catch Quacker because Quacker kept out in the water where he was as safe from them as if they were a thousand miles away The only reason that Reddy had willingly started with Granny was the hope that he might find a dead fish washed up on the shore as he had the day before Granny certainly is growing foolish in her old age thought Reddy as he trotted along behind her I told her that Quacker never once came ashore all the time I watched yesterday I dont believe he ever comes ashore and if she knows anything at all she ought to know that she cant catch him out there in the water Granny used to be smart enough when she was young I guess but she certainly is losing her mind now Its a pity a great pity I can just imagine how Quacker will laugh at her I have to laugh myself He did laugh but you may be sure he took great pains that Granny should not see him laughing Whenever she looked around he was as sober as could be In fact he appeared to be quite as eager as if he felt sure they would catch Quacker Now old Granny Fox is very wise in the ways of the Great World and if Reddy could have known what was going on in her mind as she led the way to the Big River he might not have felt quite so sure of his own smartness Granny was doing some quiet laughing herself He thinks Im old and foolish and dont know what Im about the young scamp thought she He thinks he has learned all there is to learn It isnt the least use in the world to try to tell him anything When young folks feel the way he does it is a waste of time to talk to them He has got to be shown There is nothing like experience to take the conceit out of these youngsters Now conceit is the feeling that you know more than any one else Perhaps you do Then again perhaps you dont So sometimes it is best not to be too sure of your own opinion Reddy was sure He trotted along behind old Granny Fox and planned smart things to say to her when she found that there wasnt a chance to catch Quacker the Duck I am afraid very much afraid that Reddy was planning to be saucy People who think

to visit some relatives they had never before seen Uncle Henry you must know was not very well because he had been working so hard on his Kansas farm that his health had given way and left him weak and nervous So he left Aunt Em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of the farm while he traveled far away to Australia to visit his cousins and have a good rest Dorothy was eager to go with him on this journey and Uncle Henry thought she would be good company and help cheer him up so he decided to take her along The little girl was quite an experienced traveller for she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the marvelous Land of Oz and she had met with a good many adventures in that strange country before she managed to get back to Kansas again So she

to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped sidewise Dorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to find that Uncle Henry was missing She couldnt imagine where he had gone and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him and to fear he might have been careless enough to go on deck In that case he would be in great danger unless he instantly came down again The fact was that Uncle Henry had gone to lie down in his little sleepingberth but Dorothy did not know that She only remembered that Aunt Em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle so at once she decided to go on deck and find him in spite of the fact that the tempest was now worse than ever and the ship was plunging in a really dreadful manner Indeed the little girl found it was as much as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck and as soon as she got there the wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the skirts of her dress Yet Dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the storm and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through the gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast not far away from her This might be her uncle so she called as loudly as she could Uncle Henry Uncle Henry But the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her own voice and the man certainly failed to hear her for he did not move Dorothy decided she must go to him so she made a dash forward during a lull in the storm to where a big square chickencoop had been lashed to the deck with ropes She reached this place in safety but no sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the chickens were kept than the wind as if enraged because the little girl dared to resist its power suddenly

Fulsoms Kindergarten school accompanied by their nurse Mrs Darling loved to have everything just so and Mr Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours so of course they had a nurse As they were poor owing to the amount of milk the children drank this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog called Nana who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her She had always thought children important however and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators and was much hated by careless nursemaids whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse How thorough she was at bathtime and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry Of course her kennel was in the nursery She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat She believed to her last day in oldfashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf and made sounds of contempt over all this newfangled talk about germs and so on It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved and butting them back into line if they strayed On Johns footer days she never once forgot his sweater and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsoms school where the nurses wait They sat on forms while Nana lay on the floor but that was the only difference They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves and she despised their light talk She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs Darlings friends but if they did come she first whipped off Michaels pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at Johns hair No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly and Mr Darling knew it yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked He had his position in the city to consider Nana also troubled him in another way He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him I know she admires you tremendously George Mrs Darling would assure him and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father Lovely dances followed in which the only other servant Liza was sometimes allowed to join Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maids cap though she had sworn when engaged that she would never see ten again The gaiety of those romps And gayest of all was Mrs Darling who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan Mrs Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her childrens minds It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day If you could keep awake but of course you cant you would see your own mother doing this and you would find it very interesting to watch her It is quite like tidying up drawers You would see her on her knees I expect lingering humorously over some of your contents wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up making discoveries sweet and not so sweet pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten and hurriedly stowing that out of sight When you wake in the morning the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top beautifully aired are spread out your prettier thoughts ready for you to put on I dont know whether you have ever seen a map of a persons mind Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you and your own map can become intensely interesting but catch them trying to draw a map of a childs mind which is not only confused but keeps going round all the time There are zigzag lines on it just like your temperature on a card and these are probably roads in the island for the Neverland is always more or less an island with astonishing splashes of colour here and there and coral reefs and rakishlooking craft in the offing and savages and lonely lairs and gnomes who are mostly tailors and caves through which a river runs and princes with six elder brothers and a hut fast going to decay and one very small old lady with a hooked nose It would be an easy map if that were all but there is also first day at school religion fathers the round pond needlework murders hangings verbs that take the dative chocolate pudding day getting into braces say ninetynine threepence for pulling out your tooth yourself and so on and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through and it is all rather confusing especially as nothing will stand still Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal Johns for instance had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting while Michael who was very small had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands Michael in a wigwam Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together John had no friends Michael had friends at night Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each others nose and so forth On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles We too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances between one adventure and another but nicely crammed When you play at it by day with the chairs and tablecloth it is not in the least alarming but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real That is why there are nightlights Occasionally in her travels through her childrens minds Mrs Darling found things she could not understand and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter She knew of no

might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsoms Kindergarten school accompanied by their nurse Mrs Darling loved to have everything just so and Mr Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours so of course they had a nurse As they were poor owing to the amount of milk the children drank this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog called Nana who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her She had always thought children important however and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators and was much hated by careless nursemaids whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse How thorough she was at bathtime and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry Of course her kennel was in the nursery She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat She believed to her last day in oldfashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf and made sounds of contempt over all this newfangled talk about germs and so on It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved and butting them back into line if they strayed On Johns footer days she never once forgot his sweater and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsoms school where the nurses wait They sat on forms while Nana lay on the floor but that was the only difference They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves and she despised their light talk She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs Darlings friends but if they did come she first whipped off Michaels pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at Johns hair No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly and Mr Darling knew it yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked He had his position in the city to consider Nana also troubled him in another way He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him I know she admires you tremendously George Mrs Darling would assure him and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father Lovely dances followed in which the only other servant Liza was sometimes allowed to join Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maids cap though she had sworn when engaged that she would never see ten again The gaiety of those romps And gayest of all was Mrs Darling who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan Mrs Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her childrens minds It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day If you could keep awake but of course you cant you would see your own mother doing this and you would find it very interesting to watch her It is quite like tidying up drawers You would see her on her knees I expect lingering humorously over some of your contents wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up making discoveries sweet and not so sweet pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten and hurriedly stowing that out of sight When you wake in the morning the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top beautifully aired are spread out your prettier thoughts ready for you to put on I dont know whether you have ever seen a map of a persons mind Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you and your own map can become intensely interesting but catch them trying to draw a map of a childs mind which is not only confused but keeps going round all the time There are zigzag lines on it just like your temperature on a card and these are probably roads in the island for the Neverland is always more or less an island with astonishing splashes of colour here and there and coral reefs and rakishlooking craft in the offing and savages and lonely lairs and gnomes who are mostly tailors and caves through which a river runs and princes with six elder brothers and a hut fast going to decay and one very small old lady with a hooked nose It would be an easy map if that were all but there is also first day at school religion fathers the round pond needlework murders hangings verbs that take the dative chocolate pudding day getting into braces say ninetynine threepence for pulling out your tooth yourself and so on and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through and it is all rather confusing especially as nothing will stand still Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal Johns for instance had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting while Michael who was very small had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands Michael in a wigwam Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together John had no friends Michael had friends at night Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each others nose and so forth On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles We too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf though we shall land no more Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact not large and sprawly you know with tedious distances between one adventure and another but nicely crammed When you play at it by day with the chairs and tablecloth it is not in the least alarming but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real That is why there are nightlights Occasionally in her travels through her childrens minds Mrs Darling found things she could not understand and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter She knew of no Peter and yet he was here and there in John>,)>,)"

of the harness At first he thought it was a cricket a tree toad or a bird but having determined the direction from which it came he turned his head over his shoulder and saw a small shape hanging as far out of the window as safety would allow A long black braid of hair swung with the motion of the coach the child held her hat in one hand and with the other made ineffectual attempts to stab the driver with her microscopic sunshade Please let me speak she called Mr Cobb drew up the horses obediently Does it cost any more to ride up there with you she asked Its so slippery and shiny down here and the stage is so much too big for me that I rattle round in it till Im most black and blue And the windows are so small I can only see pieces of things and Ive most broken my neck stretching round to find out whether my trunk has fallen off the back Its my mothers trunk and shes very choice of it Mr Cobb waited until this flow of conversation or more properly speaking this flood of criticism had ceased and then said jocularly You can come up if you want to there aint no extry charge to sit side o me Whereupon he helped her out boosted her up to the front seat and resumed his own place Rebecca sat down carefully smoothing her dress under her with painstaking precision and putting her sunshade under its extended folds between the driver and herself This done she pushed back her hat pulled up her darned white cotton gloves and said delightedly Oh this is better This is like traveling I am a real passenger now and down there I felt like our setting hen when we shut her up in a coop I hope we have a long long ways to go>,)>,)"

warned the family that no good could be expected from any offspring of that diabolical Jack Frost but Susans Cassandralike croakings were unheeded The Blythes had been so accustomed to regard Jack Frost as a member of the male sex that they could not get out of the habit So they continually used the masculine pronoun although the result was ludicrous Visitors used to be quite electrified when Rilla referred casually to Jack and his kitten or told Goldie sternly Go to your mother and get him to wash your fur It is not decent Mrs Dr dear poor Susan would say bitterly She herself compromised

around to enter the dock a boyish voice shouted There she is I see her and Uncle and Phebe Hooray for Cousin Rose And three small cheers were given with a will by Jamie as he stood on a post waving his arms like a windmill while his brother held onto the tail of his jacket Yes there they were Uncle Alec swinging his hat like a boy with Phebe smiling and nodding on one side and Rose kissing both hands delightedly on the other as she recognized familiar faces and heard familiar voices welcoming her home Bless her dear heart shes bonnier than ever Looks like a Madonna doesnt she with that blue cloak round her and her bright hair flying in the wind said Charlie excitedly as they watched the group upon the deck with eager eyes Madonnas dont wear hats like that Rose hasnt changed much but Phebe has Why shes a regular beauty answered Archie staring with all his might at the darkeyed young woman with the brilliant color and glossy black braids shining in the sun Dear old Uncle Doesnt it seem good to have him back was all Mac said but he was not looking at dear old uncle as he made the fervent remark for he saw only the slender blond girl nearby and stretched out his hands to meet hers forgetful of the green water tumbling between them During the confusion that reigned for a moment as the steamer settled to her moorings Rose looked down into the four faces upturned to hers and seemed to read in them something that both pleased and pained her It was only a glance and her own eyes were full but through the mist of happy tears she received the impression that Archie was about the same that Mac had decidedly improved and that something was amiss with Charlie There was no time for observation however for in a moment the shoreward rush began and before she could grasp her traveling bag Jamie was clinging to her like an ecstatic young bear She was with difficulty released from his embrace to fall into the gentler ones of the elder cousins who took advantage of the general excitement to welcome both blooming girls with affectionate impartiality Then the wanderers were borne ashore in a triumphal procession while Jamie danced rapturous jigs before them even on the gangway Archie remained to help his uncle get the luggage through the Custom House and the others escorted the damsels home No sooner were they shut up in a carriage however than a new and curious constraint seemed to fall upon the young people for they realized all at once that their former playmates were men and women now Fortunately Jamie was quite free from this feeling of restraint and sitting bodkinwise between the ladies took all sorts of liberties with them and their belongings Well my mannikin what do you think of us asked Rose to break an awkward pause Youve both grown so pretty I cant decide which I like best Phebe is the biggest and brightestlooking and I was always fond of Phebe but somehow you are so kind of sweet and precious I really think I must hug you again and the small youth did it tempestuously If you love me best I shall not mind a bit about your thinking Phebe the handsomest because she is Isnt she boys asked Rose with a mischievous look at the gentlemen opposite whose faces expressed a respectful admiration which much amused her Im so dazzled by the brilliancy and beauty that has suddenly burst upon me I have no words to express my emotions answered Charlie gallantly dodging the dangerous question I cant say yet for I have not had time to look at anyone I will now if you dont mind And to the great amusement of the rest Mac gravely adjusted his eyeglasses and took an observation Well said Phebe smiling and blushing under his honest stare yet seeming not to resent it as she did the lordly sort of approval which made her answer the glance of Charlies audacious blue eyes with a flash of her black ones I think if you were my sister I should be very proud of you because your face shows what I admire more than its beauty truth and courage Phebe answered Mac with a little bow full of such genuine respect that surprise and pleasure brought a sudden dew to quench the fire of the girls eyes and soothe the sensitive pride of the girls heart Rose clapped her hands just as she used to do when anything delighted her and beamed at Mac approvingly as she said Now thats a criticism worth having and we are much obliged I was sure youd admire my Phebe when you knew her but I didnt believe you would be wise enough to see it at once and you have gone up many pegs in my estimation I assure you I was always fond of mineralogy you remember and Ive been tapping round a good deal lately so Ive learned to know precious metals when I see them Mac said with his shrewd smile That is the latest hobby then Your letters have amused us immensely for each one had a new theory or experiment and the latest was always the best I thought Uncle would have died of laughter over the vegetarian mania it was so funny to imagine you living on
