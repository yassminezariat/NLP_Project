The bees, thinking Alfi is trying to steal their honey, fly up to confront him. They sit on the bubble to try and weigh it down, but instead it rises higher due to the warmth of the sun.

Pat told his  mother  about what had  happened  and asked  if  he  could  keep the bird .His mother thought about it for a while and then gave  Pat  permission to keep the bird until it gets  better. Pat  was  very  happy  when  his mother  said  ‘Okay’.  He  always wanted a pet and finally  he got his  first  pet,  a  Little  Blue  Bird.  He quickly  went to his room and  bandaged  the little birds’ wing. Then he made a small nest, put the nest   into a box, slowly placed the little bird into its  newly made nest and fed it some mango. Pat  wanted to give the little bird some more space   so the following morning Pat made a plan to  build a bird cage.He showed  the bird to his father and  asked for his help. His father was a professional  builder  and  he  liked Pats’ idea to make a bird  cage. First they gathered the things which were   needed  to build the bird cage, then  they started  to build it, and finally they painted  the cage. Pat had to wait impatiently until the paint was  dry so he went to check on his pet. He went to  his room and checked  the  pet  in  its  nest.  He   started to think of a nice name for the bird  while feeding  it some more mango.He wrote down some names on a piece of  paper. Later on he went and showed the list of  names that he had to his parents, both  parents chose the last name, ‘Blue’  because   it was the best name  for a female  bird, and  so  the  bird  was  called Blue. After the paint  was dry on the cage Pat put Blue on his bed and he took Blue's  nest and put it into  the cage. When he was going to lift Blue, she had pooped on Pats’  bed. He got scared that his mother would scold him because a new bed sheet was put onto the  bed that morning, but to his luck his mother laughed at the situation and she washed the bed sheet, then  she put a new one on to the bed.After this he carefully took blue and put her into  the newly made cage with water and some food.   After five weeks had passed Blue was healed  and she was ready to fly. Pat opened the door  and took Blue out. Blue first started to flap her wings harder and harder and then  started  flying.  She  flew gracefully and sang beautifully  while  flying. Pat was happy  and sad. He  thought  that Blue would not fly away but unfortunately  Blue left Pat. He loved Blue very much, and while he was happy for her, he felt  very sad and he wished that she would come   back. His parents encouraged Pat and tried to  convince him to buy a new bird but he refused.Then after about two weeks Blue came back  with another blue bird like her but the bird was  a ‘He’. Pat was surprised, happy, and thrilled   when he saw Blue again. Pat had not removed  the cage from  its place   after Blue left.  He always  had the  door of the cage open in case Blue  came back. When Pat saw the other bird he was  full of joy. The two birds went into the cage.  He called the new bird ‘Sky’. Pat took off the small   door of the cage so that they could easily go in  and out of the cage. The bond of the two blue  birds grew stronger and stronger. After two  weeks Blue laid five  small  eggs. Pat kept a careful eye on the eggs until they hatched. He kept the cage in a safe place  so predators won’t be able to eat the small nice  eggs. After two weeks had gone by the day finally came. The day that he could see the  small baby birds. He was so thrilled and excited  about this. He quickly called his parents to see. Pat felt happier and happier each moment  when they started to hatch one by one.Pat watched the five baby blue birds grow bigger and bigger each day while  their  father,  Sky,  went  on finding  food  for  the  babies.  Blue grew older and older. Unfortunately after one week had gone by Blue caught  a  viral  bird  flu.  She  was taken to a doctor but the sickness   was  incurable  because  Blue's health  was  not  good  from  giving birth. After three days had passed   by Blue and two  of her baby birds  passed  away.  It  was  a  very sorrowful day for Pat as it was his   first and very own pet that passed away with  two of its little babies.Pat held a small funeral for them. He  looked  after  the  three  small babies  very  well  and  their  father, Sky, took care of the small babies too. They soon got big and learned to fly with  the help of their father. Even though the other  birds were there he  felt  sad about  Blue because  it was his first beloved pet. He  cried  for  a  few  days  but  he decided that even though he cries   Blue won’t come  back. So he  kept in mind  that the  remaining  birds are   part of Blues’ family  and he will take care of them and rejoice in this.

Margaret was brave and fought when she  thought something was wrong.Margaret’s mother and father paid for her brother  to be educated as a lawyer. And then they used  the last of their money so that he could marry a  wealthy man’s daughter. Margaret was clever and had big dreams. But there  was no money left for her to study, not even as a  governess or a nurse. Margaret was brave. “I want to be a doctor!” she  said.

When Margaret’s uncle James Barry died, he left her  some money. “It’s enough money to study to be a  doctor!” said General Miranda. “But I can’t become a doctor,” said Margaret.  “A boy can become a doctor,” said General Miranda.  “And you can dress like a boy. ”  Margaret was brave and she fought for what she  believed in. She really wanted to be a doctor.  So she cut off her hair. She practiced speaking in a  deep voice. She put on boy’s clothes. From then onwards, no one knew that Margaret was  a girl.

The spotlight flickered on... “A fuzzy sheep zebra flock!” Everyone asked, “Do the sheep look like zebras?”    “No way!” the real zebras said very fast.    “Our stripes help us blend into tall wavy grass,   So our coats keep us safe and protect us from harm.”    “So do ours!” said the sheep. “Our curls keep us warm.”“Who will be next?” asked Mayor Horse with a smile.   The crowd saw the poster and cried, “The action star,  Mr.Crocodile!”Someone walked on stage in a crocodile costume  pretending to have his fame.   The spotlight flickered on... And everyone shouted,  “Are he and Mr. Crocodile the same?”Mr. Crocodile scoffed, “A rhinoceros?    No, we are not like each other!”   “Are you sure?”asked  the rhino, “We both have thick  armor!”   “Real crocodile have far tougher armor, “said the  croc with a groan, “It’s  not only sensitive to cold and  heat, but some parts are hard as bone!”Then Mayor Horse interrupted, “Who is next up to dance?”      All the animals shouted, “The model, Miss Giraffe!”The crowd tried to see through the darkness.    “Who is it?” they asked.    “Whose humps are those?”    The spotlight flickered on...“The dizzy camel!” they laughed.The camel, wearing fancy brown patches, got back  up on her feet.   She said, “The giraffe’s body is special and  stays cool in the heat. Just like me, she does not have to sweat  to stay cool.”    “But I don’t have two humps!” the real giraffe ruled.“Who is that making faces?” the Mayor then said.    “It looks like the comedian, Mr. Hedgehog  is curled  up for bed.”     “Silly Mr. Hedgehog rolls into a ball when he sleeps.”     The crowd shouted, “He is much funnier than the  giraffe, rhino or sheep!”But who dressed up as the Hedgehog, no one  could see.   Then the spotlight flickered on...Spines, spines, spines...    And a teeny-tiny voice squeaked, “It is me!”    “I s that mouse on a bicycle?” all the animals cried.     “That costume makes no sense! ” The mouse wanted  to hide and said “Our stiff hairs are similar to the  spines of yours.”The real Hedgehog spoke, “I don’t think he  should win. See, I’ve the prickliest coat, but the  mouse has thin skin.” “Mayor Horse came back up. “What’s that  chatter?”he asked.    “It must be Mr. Parrot!” the crowd guessed. “He’s talking so fast!”But who could be wearing Mr. Parrot’s disguise?   The spotlight flickered on...It was  Mrs . Parrot, to everyone’s surprise.“She’s a Parrot for sure, but does she look like a  male?” Mr. Parrot said, “No, we’re unique from our beak to our tail. My feathers are rich green and red----not the same. As Mrs. Parrot’s red and purple. We share only our  name.”Mayor Horse asked, “Who’s singing onstage? What a  lovely sound.”    The crowd shouted, “Miss Frog loves to sing!” They  all turned around. “Guess who dressed up as Miss Frog?” Mayor Horse  asked.   The spotlight flickered on...“M r. Frog, who was all green, but wore a  red vest. ”The green frog crooned, “My green color help me to  hide under the leaves and I think my red vest looks  stunning!”    “But my dress is not cute, it’s actually cunning. The red is a warning cause we are poisonous, too.”   Miss Frog chimed in with, “This green frog’s got no clue.”Who is next up onstage?” Mayor Horse finally asked.   The crowd answered, “It’s Allie! She must be the last.”Who was dressed up as the chef kitty?   The spotlight flickered on...Allie walked nimbly along Elephant’s trunk.   Then, she jumped on the stage with a plonk and a plunk.The kitty chef stood onstage dressed as herself,  looking proud!   And threw smiley face cookies out into the crowd.“Why do we want to copy each other to win?      Our most perfect costume is our very own skin.         Each animal has their own color and look.     Not to mention our hobbies; I love to cook!   Each cat’s coat is different to match where we live,    so before you try changing, see what you’ve got to  give.”The smiley-face cookies flew over the crowd.   The animals caught them and started cheering out  loud.   They agreed with what Allie said, and they added with a smile,    “We all win the contest because we all have our own  unique style!”“No one can copy my trunk.” The elephant smiled and  lifted Allie onto his back with his trunk.     “And these are my antlers,” the deer said with some spunk.     The hippo roared, “No one can have a huge mouth like I do.”       As everyone cheered along, too.So, what’s your best costume, girls and boys?   Come on! Stand up proud! And make a big noise!   Put on your big smile and wear your best you.   You are your best costume: You, just you!The wild cats’ coat The color and pattern of a wild cat’s coat usually  matches where it lives. For example, some wild cats with spotted or patterned coats, their coats help them to blend into the forests. Some wild cats with plain and solid colored coats usually spend more time in the dry places with low-lying grass. Wild cats’ coats let them blend into their environment. This helps protect them from pred - ators.Spiny mouse’s skin The spiny mouse’s coat is covered with stiff hairs  rather like those of a hedgehog. This is where the name comes from for the spiny mouse. Some species of the African spiny mouse can escape from predators by shedding their skin.

In all these areas she drew and painted  her specimens with increasing skill.  By the 1890s her scientific interests centred on mycology.

The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse All along the passage   she  sniffed,  and  looked at the floor  . ""I smell  a  smell of honey;  is  it the cowslips  outside  ,  in  the hedge?  I am   sure  I  can see the  marks   of  little   dirty feet."" The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Suddenly  round  a  corner  , she  met  Babbitty Bumble The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Zizz, Bizz,   Bizzz  !“ said  the  bumble   bee . Mrs.  Tittlemouse looked at her  severely  .  She  wished  that  she  had a broom  . The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse ""Good  - day,  Babbitty  Bumble;  I  should be glad to buy   some   beeswax.  But what   are you  doing   down here?  Why  do you always  come in   at a window  ,  and say,  ‘Zizz ,  Bizz ,  Bizzz  ’?""  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  began   to get cross. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse ""Zizz,   Wizz ,  Wizzz  !""  replied   Babbitty  Bumble  in  a peevish squeak.  She sidled   down  a  passage,  and  disappeared  into  a storeroom  which   had been used for acorns. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Mrs.  Tittlemouse had  eaten  the  acorns  before   Christmas;  the  storeroom ought to have  been   empty  . But it was full of  untidy   dry moss. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Mrs.  Tittlemouse began to pull  out  the moss.  Three   or four  other   bees put their heads out,  and buzzed fiercely. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse""I am not  in  the habit   of  letting lodgings  ; This  is  an  intrusion!""  said Mrs.  Tittlemouse  . The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse ""I will have  them   turned   out.“ "" Buzz! Buzz  !  Buzzz  !”  "" I wonder who  would   help me?""  "" Bizz,   Wizz ,  Wizzz  !"" The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse "" I will not have  Mr . Jackson;  he  never  wipes his   feet .“ Mrs.  Tittlemouse decided   to leave  the  bees  till  after dinner.The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse When she  got back  to  the parlour  , she  heard some  one coughing  in  a  fat voice  ;  And  there sat  Mr . Jackson  himself! The Tale of Mrs   TittlemouseHe was sitting all over  a  small rocking  - chair,  twiddling   his thumbs  and smiling  ,  with  his feet  on  the fender  . He lived in a drain  below   the hedge,  in  a very dirty wet ditch. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse ""How do you do,   Mr . Jackson?  Deary  me,  you  have got very wet!"" "" Thank you,  thank   you,  thank   you,  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  ! I'll  sit awhile  and dry   myself,""  said  Mr. Jackson. The Tale of Mrs   TittlemouseHe sat and smiled,  and  the water dripped  off  his coat tails.  Mrs.  Tittlemouse went   round with a mop. He  sat such a while that  he  had to be asked  if  he would take   some dinner  ? The Tale of Mrs   TittlemouseHe opened   his  mouth most  unnecessarily  wide ;  He  certainly  had  not  a tooth  in  his head. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Then she offered   him thistle  - down seed. "" Tiddly,   widdly  ,  widdly  !  Pouff ,  pouff ,  puff !""  said  Mr . Jackson.  He  blew the   thistle  - down  all  over  the room  . The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse ""Thank you,  thank   you,  thank   you,  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  !  Now  what  I really, really,  should   like,  would   be  a  little   dish  of honey  !"" The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse""I am afraid I have not got any,  Mr . Jackson,"" said Mrs.   Tittlemouse  . "" Tiddly,   widdly  ,  widdly  ,  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  !""  said  the smiling  Mr. Jackson  ,  "" I can   … smell …   it;  that  is why I came to call."" The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Mr . Jackson   rose ponderously  from   the  table ,  and  began to   look into the cupboards  . Mrs .  Tittlemouse followed   him  with  a dish  - cloth,   to  wipe his large   wet  footmarks off   the parlour floor. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse When   he had  convinced   himself  that  there was  no  honey  in  the cupboards, he  began to walk  down   the passage. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse "" Indeed,  indeed  ,  you  will  stick   fast,  Mr . Jackson  !“ ""Tiddly,  widdly  ,  widdly  ,  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  !"" The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse First he squeezed into the pantry. ""Tiddly,   widdly  ,  widdly  ?  no  honey? no honey,  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  ?"" There were three  creepy  - crawly   people  hiding   in the plate  - rack.  Two of them   got away;  but  the littlest one he caught. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Then he  squeezed  into  the larder.  Miss   Butterfly  was  tasting  the  sugar ; but she flew away  out of the window. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse""Tiddly,   widdly  ,  widdly  ,  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  ;  you  seem to have  plenty of visitors!“ ""And without  any  invitation!""  said  Mrs.  Thomasina  Tittlemouse  . The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse They went along the sandy   passage. "" Tiddly   widdly  …"" "" Buzz!   Wizz !  Wizz !"" He  met  Babbitty round   a corner  , and  snapped   her  up. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Then put   her  down again. ""I do not like  bumble   bees . They   are all  over bristles  ,""  said  Mr. Jackson, wiping   his mouth   with  his coat  - sleeve. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse ""Get out, you nasty old toad!""  shrieked   Babbitty  Bumble  . ""I shall go distracted!""  scolded   Mrs.  Tittlemouse  . The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse She shut   herself up in the  nut - cellar   while Mr. Jackson  pulled   out  the bees  - nest .  He  seemed to have  no  objection to stings. When   Mrs.  Tittlemouse ventured   to come   out,  everybody  had  gone away. The Tale of Mrs   TittlemouseBut the untidiness  was  something   dreadful "" Never did I see  such a mess:  smears   of honey;  and  moss,  and thistledown, and  marks of big   and little   dirty   feet,  all  over my nice clean house!"" The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse She gathered up the moss  and  the remains of the beeswax. Then   she went out  and  fetched  some   twigs,  to  partly close up  the front door. ""I will make it   too  small   for  Mr . Jackson!"" The Tale of Mrs   TittlemouseShe fetched soft soap,   and  flannel,  and  a new  scrubbing   brush  from the storeroom  .  But  she was  too  tired to do  any  more.  First   she fell   asleep in   her chair, The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Then   she  went   to bed  . ""Will   my house  ever  be tidy again?""  said  poor  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  . The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse Next morning  she  got up  very early. She  began   a  spring cleaning  which lasted  a  fortnight. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse She swept,  and  scrubbed,  and  dusted  ; and  she  rubbed   up  the  furniture with beeswax  , and  polished her  little tin spoons. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse When it was all  beautifully  neat  and clean,  she  gave a party  to five other  little   mice,  without  Mr .  Jackson … The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse But he   smelt  the  party  and  came  up  the bank  , but  he  could   not  squeeze  in at the   door. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse So they   handed  him out  acorn  - cupfuls of honey  - dew through   the  window  , and he was not  at  all offended. The Tale of Mrs   Tittlemouse He sat outside  in  the sun,  and said,  "" Tiddly,  widdly  ,  widdly  !  Your  very good   health,  Mrs .  Tittlemouse  !""

FKB-Stories-faceToFaceWithTheGorillaKing.txt,"Part One “It’s not every day that a trip to the zoo can lead to you ending up on the other side of the Galaxy” It’s not every day that a trip to the zoo can lead to you  ending up on the other side of the Galaxy. I mean it’s  not something you expect is it? One minute you’re  looking at a very bored Tapir and the next you are  standing in fantastic palace before a very grumpy gorilla sitting on a large, golden throne. The day started out okay. Well it was a bit boring if I am  honest. We got up, got dressed and had breakfast. I  wore my “Nature is wild” t-shirt. It’s really cool with a  picture of a small deer in the mouth of a large lion. Mum doesn’t like it but I insisted that this was the perfect day to wear it. We had breakfast and set out to catch the  train to the zoo. Dad had taken the day off so the whole  family could go, it being half-term and all. Mum fussed  over whether I was warm enough and Dad strode off at  a heck of a pace towards the station. All pretty much  normal. The train journey was fairly uneventful as well.  After a quick change onto another line we arrived at the  zoo in good time. I was keen to see the lions but my  sister, Jodie, wanted to see the penguins. The penguins  were nearer to the entrance so we went there first. They were pretty cute I have to say and the way they walked  was quite funny. They’re swimming was amazing,  particularly when you looked through the glass walls  into the tank. I guess I should have realised something  was up though as at one point I crawled into a bubble  window to see the inside of tank and suddenly all the  penguins swam over towards me. For a second I thought they were pointing at me but as I turned to tell my Dad  the keeper arrived with a bucket of fish and they all  swam off towards her. Something similar happened at the reptile house. When  I looked into the Komodo dragon enclosure one of them  spotted me and, quick as a flash, ran over towards me.  Others spotted it and ran over as well. By the time we  had covered half the zoo I was getting very worried. Not only were the zoo animals apparently attracted to me  but there was a growing collection of seagulls, pigeons  and insects all seemingly following me. We asked a zoo  keeper what might be the problem but he just said the  animals probably mixed me up with a keeper and came  over for food. When I asked why the birds and insects  were following me, he said I was probably imagining it  and they often hang around the zoo. If he had been with us at the Ape house he would have  changed his mind. The pride of the zoo is a large  silverback called Titan. You’d recognise him from all the  posters, bags, t-shirts, caps, badges, stickers, mugs and stationery with his picture on. When we arrived he was  sitting in a hammock strung between two trees. As soon as we turned the corner and could see him, he started  staring at me. Then, slowly he got up and walked over  to our side of the enclosure. Normally being approached by a gorilla of that size would be quite frightening but  we had a wall and a deep, wide pit between us so I  wasn’t that worried. I was surprised though because he  wouldn’t take his eyes off me. Actually as he got close I  realised he couldn’t take his eyes off my t-shirt. “Do you like this shirt?” I asked in a patronising voice.  The gorilla just stared at me then turned and walked  away again. He disappeared into the buildings at the  back of the enclosure and after a while reappeared with  something in his hand. It looked like a brick but as he  got closer I saw that it was a piece of carved, dark  wood. I have to say I was transfixed. I stood there  watching the huge, magnificent animal as it strode  around the enclosure. He climbed up onto a platform  and sat down. The wood was still in his hand and he  held it up to his mouth as if to chew it. Suddenly he  launched it high into the air and we all looked to see it  flying towards us. It landed with a clatter behind me.  Nobody spoke but some let out a grasp. The gorilla  looked me in the eye and gestured towards the piece of  wood behind me. Did he want me to throw it back? If so  I doubt I could get it across the trench, let alone as far  as the platform. I turned and went over to it. “Don’t touch it!” Dad said, “You might catch germs from the gorilla.” “Or pass some onto him.” Mum added. “He wants me to throw it back.” I said, bending down to  it. The carving was very intricate and detailed. I could  see what looked like writing on the underside and,  without thinking, I turned it over. As soon as I touched it  there was a bright flash of white light and all of the  noises of the zoo stopped. I must have passed out  because for a second I couldn’t see. Then gradually my  sight returned and I realised I was lying on the floor. I  stood up and brushed myself down. That was when I  realised the floor had changed. Where there had been  concrete, now there was polished marble. Also, where I  had been out in the open before, now I was in a large  room. Around the edges of the room were ornate chairs  and the walls were decorated with silk fabric of the  richest blues, purples and reds. The chairs were carved  and covered in gold. In each chair sat an occupant who  held a white tube about a quarter of a metre long with  gold caps on the ends. Each occupant was an ape of some kind. There were  orangutans with large heads, chimpanzees sitting  crossed-legs and gorillas with stern looks on their faces.  I saw a wide strip of purple carpet stretch from some  huge doors to a set of steps at one end of the room. At  the top of the steps was a large, golden throne with long waves of white silk draped over it. On the throne sat a  large silverback gorilla who leaned towards me and  beckoned me with a finger. I stood rooted to the spot. I  had no idea whether this was a dream or not but even if it was, it was one of the weirdest I’d ever had. The  silverback again beckoned me closer with it’s finger. I  started to walk towards the throne when a cough to one side made me turn and look. One of the chimps was  bowing its head and indicated I should do the same. I  did and continued walking until I reached the edge of  the carpet. Not knowing what to do next I stood there,  with my head bowed. The silverback stood and walked down the steps to me.  It took my chin gently in its hand and turned my head to each side as if inspecting it. I have to say I was petrified. I knew enough about gorillas to know that with one arm  this creature could deliver a blow which would kill me.  After a few moments of this inspection the silverback let go of my chin and stepped back a bit. Then something  really weird happened and, considering what kind of day it had been, that’s saying something. The silverback  spoke. It looked around the room and spoke with a loud, deep voice. “So this is the one. This is the human child the prophecy speaks of?” An orangutan stood and spoke “Lord Titan seems quite  certain of it my king. He says he was told the boy had  arrived at the zoo but refused to believe it. When the  child arrived at the enclosure Lord Titan saw for himself  and was immediately convinced.” “This cloth the child wears,” the silverback replied,  stroking my shirt, “how close to the description in the  prophecy is it?” “It is a perfect match my king.” The orangutan  responded. “Then he must be the one.” The gorilla said. Then it  turned to me and said “And you child, what do you have to say for yourself, can you do it?” I suppose saying something, anything would have  helped but all I could do was stand there with my mouth open.  Part Two “Well, you’re a long way from Earth now.” ""Does the child speak?"" The gorilla snapped. I must  have stood there with my mouth agape for a little too  long. It was just such an amazing situation to be in that I couldn't find any words. Here I was, face to face with a  huge silverback gorilla, in some kind of elaborate palace - his palace apparently and he was talking to me. An orangutan to one side spoke quietly to me. ""It would  be advisable for you to answer his majesty, young  human."" ""I'm not altogether what to say."" I replied, without  thinking. ""You can start by answering my question child!"" the  gorilla roared. ""My king,"" said the orangutan, ""calm yourself. There  are,"" it paused, ""guests in the palace."". The gorilla  snorted and started at me. I felt I should probably  answer his question. ""I'm afraid I cannot tell you if I can do something your  majesty, unless I am first told what it is."" Now it was the gorilla's turn to be stunned. He glanced  at the orangutan who shrugged. ""You mean to say,"" the orangutan said, ""you do no know why you are here?"" ""That is correct."" I said. ""Did Lord Titan not explain before he sent you?"" the  silverback asked. ""I presume Lord Titan is the gorilla from the zoo,"" I said  and saw both the apes before me nod, ""in which case I  am afraid he didn't say anything to me. Not even that  he was going to send me here. I don't even know where  I am."" ""What?"" the gorilla asked angrily. There was a raucous  noise from the apes around the room. ""You mean, lord  Titan has sent a boy to fulfil the prophecy and the child  has no knowledge of either it or of my kingdom which  he will save?"" ""It would appear so, my king."" said the orangutan,  meekly. ""Can this child, a human child no less, really fulfil the  prophecy under such circumstances?"" the gorilla turned  and went back to his throne. ""We can but pray, your majesty."" the orangutan said.  Then it paused for a while and added ""Perhaps we  should consult an expert on the prophecy?"" ""Are there any, above me?"" ""No my king, of course not."" The orangutan bowed, ""but perhaps Augustus might be able to ascertain if this is  indeed the prophesied boy."" ""Hmmf!"" puffed the gorilla, ""that old has-been refuses  to come to my court. Why would he take on this  human?"" ""Because my king, Augustus is obsessed with the  prophecy."" The gorilla thought for a moment and then dismissed us with a wave of his arm. ""Fine, take him to Augustus and  see what he can do with him. But the battle is in two  days and, prophecy or no, this boy will be entered into  it."" ""My King."" said the orangutan and then to me. ""Come  with me, human.""  and he walked off. I followed, mostly  because I had no idea what else to do."" We left the large hall through a small door in the corner  and walked through a maze of corridors. We went down  a few levels although there were no stairs. Instead there were knotted ropes and the occasional pole. My guide  descended these with a lot more grace and ease than I  did. By the time we arrived at a small, dark room I was  quite puffed out. The orangutan indicated I should wait  and then walked slowly into the darkness. ""Augustus?"" ""What do you you want, Sharif?"" came a gruff voice  from the dark. ""You have a visitor, by order of the king."" The orangutan replied. It was clear these two did not get along. ""So his majesty thinks he still has need of me, does he?"" mumbled the voice, ""What has he sent me now?"" ""A boy."" ""I no longer take apprentices. The king knows that."" ""I didn't say a youngling. I said a boy. A human."" ""A human?"" said the voice. ""You mean the prophecy?"" ""That is for you to determine, Augustus."" A shape shuffled out of the darkness. ""Oh this I will  see."" said the voice. I watched, more than a little afraid,  as the shape stepped into the light and became a grey  chimpanzee. It walked, dragging one leg, right up to me  and held my chin, much as the gorilla king had. After a  few moments inspecting me the chimpanzee said ""You  may leave."" I started to turn but the chimp held onto  me. ""Not you boy. He,"" it nodded towards Sharif, ""may  leave."" Sharif turned and started to leave speaking over his  shoulder. ""The battle is in two days, Augustus."" ""I know."" said the chimp, ""I have known for longer than  you."" It released my chin and stood back. ""So, young man.  Who are you?"" ""My name is.."" ""I don't care what your name is. ""The chimp interrupted, ""I asked who you are. Where have you come from."" ""Earth."" I said. ""Ah, one of Titan's. How did you get here?"" ""I don't know. I was at the zoo and a gorilla threw  something at me. When I touched it, I passed out and  woke up in the king's throne room."" ""Was it wooden, this object?"" ""Yes it was."" ""With carvings?"" ""Yes."" ""And where is it now, this object?"" ""I don't know."" I replied. I decided to push my luck a bit.  ""Can you tell me where I am, I mean this isn't Earth and  I have no idea what any of you are talking about."" ""That makes sense."" said Augustus. ""I imagine apes that can speak are the stuff of stories on Earth?"" ""Yes they are."" ""Well, you're a long way from Earth now. This world has  no humans on it. There used to be but they all died in  the first centuries of the war."" ""War? The gorilla king and the orangutan said  something about a battle. Who are you fighting?"" The chimp laughed, ""We're not fighting anyone, not  anymore. We used to. Whole armies of warriors lost  their lives in the battles of old but war has become more sophisticated since then. Now we have smaller battles  with select warriors. The winner of the battle gets to  rule the world, until the next one."" ""So these battles are smaller?"" ""Much smaller and more entertaining."" ""You didn't answer me."" I said, ""Who are your  opponents?"" ""Ah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that but as you  have."" he sat as he spoke and gestured for me to do the same. ""Long ago this world divided into factions, all of  whom wanted supremacy over the others. At first the  factions all fought each other, then we made alliances  but as ever they were soon broken. Then somebody  came up with the idea of the battles. The idea is that  the factions are paired off against each other with the  winner given the chance to face the winner of another  battle. Eventually only two will remain and then there  will be the final battle. The winner shall reign over the  whole world."" ""And the gorilla king leads one of those two factions?"" ""You catch on quickly boy."" the chimpanzee smiled, ""Yes, where there were once fourteen factions, now there  remains two. The Simians and the Reptilia."" ""Simian? You mean apes?"" ""Yes and other primates and Reptilia meaning reptiles  and their kind."" ""Lizards?"" ""Yes, all kinds of reptiles to be exact. If they win, the  king fears all the world will descend into darkness."" He  saw my puzzled look and added ""You have a question,  boy?"" ""Yes,"" I said, ""what happens to the other factions? The  ones who have been defeated in previous battles?"" ""A good question. They are made to serve the victors.  The two factions become one."" ""So they become slaves? That can't be right!"" ""Right?"" smirked the grey chimp, ""Since when did right  have anything to do with war?"" ""So where do I come into all this then?"" ""Well, "" said Augustus picking at his toenail, ""many  years ago a prophecy was made by one of the great  wise apes. It said that when the final battle approached, a human child would be sent. It was said that this  human would end the battles forever, bring freedom to  all simian kind and, through them, to the whole world."" I puffed out my cheeks, ""and you think that's me?"" ""Titan does."" ""The king mentioned something about my shirt?"" ""Ah I hadn't noticed that but yes, it is remarkably similar to the prophecy."" I must have looked puzzled so it  explained further. ""The prophecy said the child would be a boy of around your age and would wear a distinctive  attire: green and bearing an image of a big cat  devouring a grazer."" ""Well that does sound like my shirt."" I said. ""What else  did this prophecy say?"" ""Nothing much really."" he smiled, ""You know how these  things are? They are always vague and open to  misinterpretation."" ""So what does the king expect me to be able to do?"" ""Do?"" ""That's why he sent me to you. To find out if I can do 'it'. I just don't know what 'it' is?"" ""Hmm,"" said the large ape, ""I suspect neither does he.  He will imagine, as have others, that you will fight in the final battle."" ""Fight? Against reptiles?"" ""I don't imagine he wants you to fight for them."" ""No I mean, I can't fight. I'm just a kid!"" ""Well you may be that but you are here and there is no  other human on this world."" ""I'll get hurt, I could die!"" ""I imagine that's the point of a battle."" ""Well I'm not doing it! Can you help me get back  home?"" For the first time since arriving I thought of my  family, back at the zoo, probably wondering where I  was. ""No, I can't but I can help you understand the  prophecies so you have a better chance with the task."" ""I told you,"" I snapped, ""I'm not fighting!"" Augustus leaned towards me. ""You may have no  choice."" ""There is always a choice."" The large ape sat back and grinned, showing what teeth he still had. He gasped as he spoke, ""You are the one."" ""What?"" ""You are the one the prophecies speak of. I am  convinced of it."" ""I told you, I'm not fighting..wait prophecies? There's  more than one?"" He chuckled, ""Did you not think the other factions would have their own wise ones, all of whom prophesied  victory for their faction?"" ""But how can they all be right?"" ""Exactly. They can't but still the kings put their trust in  them because their subjects need to believe they will  win."" ""What about when they lose?"" ""In that case the victorious faction will declare only their prophet had true insight and thus justifies them  continuing in the war."" ""You mean they could stop?"" ""Indeed but it would mean trusting the other factions  not to invade or enslave them."" ""So nobody will take the risk?"" ""You are smarter than you appear."" ""So what did the other factions say about me?"" ""Mostly the same stuff, that a human child would  appear before the final battle and free the world from  this continuous war."" ""But each said the human would make their faction  victorious?"" ""Well, actually, no."" ""No?"" ""None of the prophecies say anything about a winner,  just that the war will end. Of course the factions have all chosen to interpret their prophecy as meaning they will  be victorious."" ""So who will win?"" ""Nobody knows, although that is not a popular view  around here."" ""But that is what you think?"" ""Yes. The king banished me to this room for saying as  much. He insists I am free to enter court at any time as  long as I declare the prophecy speaks of simian victory."" ""And you can't do that?"" ""I won't do it."" All of this was very interesting but I was still trying to  think how to get our of fighting and how to get home. ""Do the prophecies say what happens to the child after  the battle? I mean if I survive, do I get to go home?"" ""They don't mention that specifically and to be honest if you were the king of the victorious faction would you  want to send away the one who gave you victory?"" ""So I'm stuck here?"" ""Maybe."" ""Can you help me get home?"" ""It is possible you could return the way you came but  you would need the object that transferred you here."" ""The piece of wood?"" the ape nodded, ""Do you know  where it is?"" ""If it is what I think then it will be locked away by now.  However, the king considers it important to his victory  and will probably bring it out at the battle."" ""So if I could get to it there, it would take me home?"" ""Yes but consider if you want to go home and the  consequences if you do."" ""Consequences?"" ""If you leave before the battle ends, the simians will  have to concede defeat to the Reptilia. The whole world  will be enslaved to them."" ""But if I stay, and the simians win, the world will be  enslaved to them. Is that any better and who am I to  decide such a thing anyway?"" The chimpanzee smiled. ""Are all humans as wise as  you?"" ""I'm not sure I am to be honest but no were not. In fact  we have moments of wisdom and even more of  stupidity."" I leaned in towards Augustus and looked into  his eyes. They had a brightness which made him look  younger. ""Will you help me to get to that piece of  wood?"" He thought and then said ""I thought you'd never ask."" Part Three “Your majesty, these fine simians require a strong leader at this time.” Augustus looked deep into my eyes and sat back down.  I have to say I was a little disappointed because I  thought he was going to show me where the piece of  wood was. Whatever it was, I needed it to get back  home from this world where animals fought battles for  supremacy. ""Well?"" I asked. ""Hmm?"" Augustus seemd deep in thought. ""Oh, I  suppose you're expecting me to take you to the  Container. Sorry but I can't do that. I don't know where  it is."" ""The Container is the wooden object we've been talking  about is it?"" ""Quite. It is the most ancient object on our world and  whichever king holds it is ruler of our planet. It is that  piece of wood that everybody is fighting for. At present  it is held by the Simian king but the last battle of this  age will bring an end to that if he loses to the Reptilia."" ""I'm confused."" I said, ""This age?"" ""The container is fought over in a series of battles with  the victor ruling the planet for five years after he has  won the last battle. In the final month of those five  years the battles take place to see who will rule for the  next five years. We call those five years an age."" ""So when you said the winner of the battle gets to rule  until the next one you meant the next winner not the  next battle?"" ""Hmm? Oh yes that is correct my boy."" ""So what's in it then?"" ""In what?"" ""This container. What does it contain?"" ""Nobody knows."" ""You mean you've never opened it?"" ""Many have considered doing so but the legends say  when the container is opened life here will end."" ""You mean like a massive explosion or something?"" ""Over the years many have speculated how it will end  but in truth the legend only says that life will end, not  how."" the Chimp picked up an apple and started eating  it. He tossed one at me as well which I am glad to say I  caught. I'm not sure I'd have found it in all that mess if I  had dropped it. ""If you don't know where it is, how can you help me get  to it?"" I said. ""I know where it should be, where it is supposed to be  but if what I have heard is correct it is not there. The  king has moved it."" ""When I arrived here, the container was nowhere to be  seen yet it still felt like my fingers were touching it."" ""That may have been the one in your world that you  could feel. Perhaps your fingers were remembering what it felt like."" That confused me even more. ""Could we at least look  where the container is supposed to be?"" ""It is supposed to be under the king's throne. To remove  it would require him to be not on his throne and for the  throne room to be empty. Those two things never  happen at the same time."" ""So how can I get to it?"" ""Again, have you considered the consequences of  reaching it?"" I sighed, ""I know the world will end but I need to get  home and this isn't my world?"" ""Would you really leave before the battle knowing it  would enslave the world to one tyrant or another?"" I shrugged. ""I'd like to but no, I don't think I can."" ""Exactly."" smiled the ape, ""Now I said I would help you  get to it but that will not be here and now. I will help you to take part in the battle."" ""I said I'm not fighting!"" ""You may not need to. If we can get you to the container during the battle all you'll need to is open it."" ""I thought just touching it would send me back home?"" ""No,"" the chimpanzeefrowned, ""it is not the same object as the one that sent you here. That is infusd with magic  whereas this one is made of magic."" ""Made of magic?"" I grinned. ""Yes. It looks like wood but it is not wood. Nobody knows what it is made of. I do know that if you open it you  have a better chance of getting back to your home and  this world not descending into slavery. ""So what do I tell the king? He'll be expecting me to  fight."" ""Yes but he is also expecting you to know what it is you  must do. Now you do and you can tell him that you  know."" ""Without telling what it is I am going to do."" he smiled  as I finished his sentence. ""Indeed. Come I'll take you back to the throne room.""  and with that Augustus swept off up the corridor I had  arrived through. -- The king was just as grumpy when I arrived back.  Augustus used the journey to advise me on what to say  and how to say it but he would not enter the throne  room. Instead he stood just outside the door. ""So you have returned?"" The king said, ""I note you were  unable to convince Augustus to correct his blasphemy."" ""With respect oh king,"" I bowed my head as I spoke,  ""that was not my task. I have returned because I now  know what it is I must do."" The gorilla made deep huffing sound and said ""So what  is it you must do child?"" ""I am not at liberty to say, your majesty."" As Augustus predicted this enraged the huge silverback  and he leapt off the throne to just in front of me.  ""What!? You dare defy me?"" ""Defy? No."" I smiled, ""I am not at liberty because what I  must do must not be revealed before its time. Your  advisers know the prophecy says this. Did they not  inform you, oh king? This was a dangerous move but it worked, the king's  focus immediately shifted to his advisers instead of my  task. The advisers shifted and ducked, some locked  their gaze on me though. ""Well?"" the king asked his court, ""Is what the child say  true?"" No-one spoke and the shifting continued. There were  some mutterings but nothing anyone else could hear. ""Speak!"" the king roared. ""Enough of these secrets!"" An oraguntan, not the one who escorted me to  Augustus, shuffled forward and bowed low. ""My king,"" it  said, ""The prophecies are not always clear. What the  child says may be taken from but one interpretation of  them."" ""Do you believe that?"" the silverback asked. ""My king..."" ""DO YOU?!"" ""It seems a popular interpretation of the writings, yes.""  the orangutan bowed and returned to its place. ""If I may continue, your majesty."" I said quietly. The  gorilla waved a hand at me and sat back down. ""Whilst I cannot reveal what it is I must do before time, there are  certain things I need that will help me prepare."" I  gulped, ""such as the Container."" There was an uproar. A cacophony arose among the  apes around the room and got louder. Eventually the  king stood and gradually silence crept around the room. ""You want our most precious keepsake?"" the king said,  ""and you expect me to just hand it over?"" I took a breath, Augustus said this was the most crucial  part of the exercise. I had to get this right or the king  could kill me in his anger. ""Yes, your majesty but before you protest you should  consider,"" I looked around the room, ""you should all  consider what it is you expect of me."" Stunned silence greeted me so I continued. ""You expect  me to end the battle and I shall. You expect me to end  the prospect of a tyrannical rule on this world and I  shall, you expect me to do this without preparation or  consideration and that I shall not do. If I am unable to  prepare, I may be unable to fulfil my duties. To prepare I need a quiet, secluded place and I need to examine the  Container."" ""Why?"" a chimpanzee to my left asked. I spun and raised my voice. ""Because I am the  prophesied one. Because I am the one who can end the  battles and because I am the only one who can interpret it and I note you dare to speak before your king without  his permission."" The chimp backed down as he saw I  rose to his challenge. The king grinned at my last  sentence. Augustus had coached me on this. He warned I would be challenged and this was how to defeat the  challengers before they got too loud. I steeled myself  and stepped towards the throne. There were gasps  around the room. I continued walking and when I got to  the foot of the throne I knelt and looked beneath it. As  Augustus suspected there was nothing there. I stood  again and faced the room. ""Your king takes his authority from the throne which is  placed above your most sacred treasure, the Container.  Except the Container is not beneath the throne."" Again there was a cacophony and I held up my hand to  silence the room and turned to the king. ""Your majesty,  where is it?"" The king shifted and glared at me. ""You dare challenge  me?"" he said. I smiled, ""I have no desire for your throne, you may  keep it but you will tell me where the Container is or  else I will not be responsible for the consequences."" I  was beginning to question how long I could bluff like  this. Surely the king would expect me to back up my  bold talk. Again the king shifted and snorted and glared at me.  ""Your majesty,"" I smiled, ""these fine simians require a  strong leader at this time. Strength comes in many  forms though and right now you need to show you are  strong enough to trust me. Give me the Container and  then you can return to being the great ape leader you  should be."" I looked him in the eye and said ""Would you  not agree, Servus?"" The gorilla looked shocked. Nobody had called him by  his name in years. This was unsurprising considering it  meant ""servant"". Obviously he didn't consider it a good  name for a king. ""So Augustus has been busy with you boy?"" he smiled.  ""You think you can come here and shock me by using  my former name? You are mistaken."" ""With respect, I seek not to shock you but to remind  you, King Servus. The position you hold is one of honour but that honour comes not from the throne but the  heart that sits upon it. You can and should be both king  and servant of these your family, King Servus."" as I  bowed a large number of apes all bowed too. I  continued, ""Show your people what a king they have.  Trust me."" The large silverback thought and eventually said ""Fetch  it."" ""My king?"" a courtier asked. ""Fetch the Container. Take it to my quarters and take the boy there too."" then he looked at me, ""You make a  convincing argument my child. Either that or you repeat another's argument,"" he looked towards the door where  he thought Augustus would be listening, ""but regardless of that I have no choice. If I refuse I shall be the king  who resided over our defeat. Therefore I have no choice  but to let you examine the Container. ""Your majesty."" I bowed as I was again escorted out of  the court by the same orangutan. Servus called after me, ""Know this, boy: if you fail me,  the last thing I shall do is rip your head from your body."" I bowed and continued to walk out backwards. We soon entered a large, well decorated room, in the  centre of the room was a large table and on that sat a  dusty wooden box. I walked over carefully and went to  wipe the dust off with my sleeve. ""Don't"" said a voice in the shadows. ""Why not?"" I asked. ""Because,"" Augustus said as he crept into the light, ""to  do that you will touch the box. To do that without  examining it would be foolish. You do not know what it  can do."" ""Do you know?"" I asked. ""No,"" he replied curtly, ""but I know how to read it."" He inspected the box and the carvings without touching  it. Giving the occasional ""hmm"" or ""ah"" as he did so.  Eventually he turned to face me and laughed. ""What?"" I asked. ""The container."" he smirked, ""It may be more familiar to  you than you or I imagined. Look here."" He indicated some of the carvings and then directed my gaze to another side with different markings. ""Is that..?"" I asked leaning in. ""Yes it is."" my chimp friend said. I turned to look at him. You mean all this the time the  battles have been little more than .."" ""Shhh!"" he cut me off, whispering ""There are more than  just our ears in here."" ""OK,"" I whispered, ""but how does this help us?"" ""Open the box and you'll see."" I slowly put my hands on the box and felt for the groove  near the top. Slowly I placed my thumb beneath it and  lifted the lid. I looked inside and smiled. ""What do you see?"" Augustus asked. ""Nothing much."" I smiled. ""But that is helpful to you, yes?"" ""Oh yes,"" I smiled again, ""and no. I now know what can  be done but not how."" ""That is where I come in, I suppose?"" muttered the  greying chimp. ""Yes I rather think it is."" At that point the door opened and Servus walked in. I  closed the lid of the box and stood before it. ""So you are here my foe!"" Servus snapped at Augustus. ""I am not your enemy Servus. Only you have ever been  that."" Augustus snapped back. ""I am not in your classroom now, old fool!"" The king  strode around the room as he spoke. ""Who's more foolish, me or the one who believes me?"" The king ignored this remark and turned to me. ""What  of you child? Do you have the information you require to grant us victory?"" ""I have the information I require to end the battles."" I  replied calmly. ""Good. Then go prepare yourself."" The king snatched up  the Container. ""The battle will commence tomorrow  morning."" ""Tomorrow?"" said Sharif, the orangutan who  accompanied the king. ""But the battle is set to be in two days."" ""I have moved it."" the King snorted, ""to catch our  enemy unprepared."" ""Can he do that?"" I whispered to Augustus. Augustus  smiled and shook his head gently. ""It appears he has."" then turning he started to leave the room. ""You dare turn your back on your king?"" Sharif  demanded. Augustus half turned and snarled at Sharif. ""When I  have a king worth facing, Sharif, I will face him. Now I  will go, with my young friend here,"" he took my arm and dragged my towards him, ""and prepare him for what he  must do."" As we started to walk out, Servus called after us.  ""Augustus, make sure the boy does not fail me."" Augustus stopped and spoke without turning. ""If I were  you Servus, I would be more concerned if it was I who  failed him."" We left the room and went back to Augustus' dwelling. ""Now,"" Augustus said, ""let's have something to eat."" ""Eat?"" I spluttered, ""surely we have to figure out what to do tomorrow."" ""There is nothing to figure out. You know what must be  done."" ""Yes, but not how to do it."" ""Oh I think you can figure out that little bit without me.""  the grey chimp smiled at me and headed for a food  cupboard. Part four “Do not fail me now boy!” We ate in silence. I was somewhat preoccupied with the  task before me and Augustus, realising this, spent most  of his time examining his food in minute detail.  Eventually it was I who broke the stifling silence. ""I know what the Container is.” I said, “I know what I  should do. I can't for the life of me think how I am going  to get the other faction to comply."" I tossed my half- eaten apple to the floor with a sigh. ""That,"" replied my chimp companion, ""was a waste of  good food."" He looked at me and I shrugged. He seemed to study me and then said the last thing I was  expecting. ""Tell me about your family."" ""My family?"" ""I presume you have one?"" ""Yes, yes of course I do. I just don't see how that will  help."" ""Humour and old ape will you?"" I sighed and told him of my parents, of my twin little  sisters and our home. He gestured for me to go on and  so I did, speaking about our daily life and what we get  up to. ""It's funny,"" I said, ""I always quite liked my life  until I came here. Now I see how boring it all is."" ""Boring?"" the ape chuckled, ""My dear human your life is  only boring if you make it so. From what you have told  me, your life sounds full and active."" ""Yes,"" I retorted, ""but not with anything exciting."" ""Exciting does not mean the same thing for everybody. I would imagine your sisters have very different tastes?"" ""That's true."" I said, ""They may be identical but they  could not be more different."" I looked at him, ""What is  the story between you and Servus anyway?"" ""I was his tutor for many years."" the ape started to  smile as he spoke, ""He was always destined to lead the  Simians. Not just because he was born into the right  family but because he had a way about him that made  others listen. The trouble was he was always limited in  his outlook. He had a very narrow view on the world. He  was cautious of the world and eventually that made him paranoid about it. He only ever seemed to want to move one step at a time. I was brought in to broaden his  horizons, teach him to look beyond what was in front of  him. So to speak."" He shrugged. I realised that the more often we spoke the less often I looked on him as an  animal. To me he was just Augustus and it was the most natural thing in the world to hear him speak. ""How long did you tutor him?"" ""Oh about ten years I think. He enjoyed it too. I told him  tales of history and tales of fiction. I showed him how to  think beyond what everyone expected, how to use the  advice of those around him and when not to."" ""So what went wrong?"" ""His mother got sick. He was already King by then and  he had surrounded himself with a host of courtiers and  advisers. The problem was that few of them were in it  for him. They were more interested in their own  position, their own status, their own power. When his  mother got sick, he summoned his advisers, including  me. He was in grief and demanded we advise him how  to save his mother. Of course none of us could do that  because, sadly, she was suffering from an illness  nobody recovers from. The other advisers were too  afraid to tell him the truth and so they told him what he  wanted to hear. They told him she had an outside  chance if he did this or said that."" ""And you didn't?"" He shook his head, ""No. I told him what he needed to  hear - as gently as I could of course. I also  advised him  to spend time with his mother, to enjoy the moments  they still had and make them precious memories. He  got very angry with me, saying I had given up, saying I  was weak. I tried to explain but he started shouting  about his position and the battles. When I repeatedly  told him that the battles were not the future of our  world, he got furious and he threw me out. I have never  been back to his court but occasionally he will ask my  opinion on a prophecy-related matter. Usually my  responses only serve to make him more angry."" ""He seems to get angry a lot."" ""He's never really gotten over the loss of his mother. It's like he thinks he will dishonour her memory if he fails to  become the ultimate ruler of the world."" ""He's that upset about it?"" ""Losing one's queen is a blow to anyone - especially in  this world. This queen in particular was both wonderful  and wise. She had Servus' ability to captivate others but without the limitation Servus placed upon himself. With  her you felt she could and would go anywhere for her  people."" “So Servus has been like this since she died?” Augustus shook his head in sadness ""I don’t think he  has ever felt up to the task of ruling without her."" ""None of this helps me with my task of course."" I said.  Then something occurred to me. ""Before he was king,  did Servus take part in the battles?"" ""Yes.” “Alongside his mother?” “He stood on her right flank."" ""So that means he was..."" I paused, ""Do you think he  was happier in that position or as King?"" ""Oh without a doubt he was happier on the flank. He  preferred to take the battle to the enemy rather than  wait for them to come to him."" ""Even with all his forces to command - ready to fall for  him?"" ""Well, as King he has always wanted to lead from the  front - as his mother did but that's not how it works. By  the time he gets to take part in the battle.."" I interrupted ""He has limited forces left and is somewhat more vulnerable."" ""Exactly."" The ape smiled at me. ""You have a plan, don't  you?"" ""Yes I think we can use that vulnerability to our  advantage. It's risky though and it won't work unless the Reptilia act how I need them to."" Augustus puffed his cheeks, ""You want to speak to their  king? I can do that for you."" “I am hoping you would but I also need something else  from you my friend.” ""Oh so I am your friend, now you want something from  me?"" The greying chimp stared at me and then smiled.  ""I think I like that."" ""You may not like it when you hear what you have to  do."" ""I take it this is something only I can do then?"" ""I'm afraid so. I am also presuming your reputation as  Servus' enemy goes beyond the Simians."" ""Oh I should hope so. I’d be disappointed if it didn’t.” He grinned, “So tell me this plan of yours."" I outlined my thoughts over the next hour or so, fine- tuning them as Augustus told me more about the  Reptilia king. To my surprise he told me the Reptilia  were ruled not by a Tyrannosaur or other fierce-looking  dinosaur but by an old giant tortoise called Sapie.  Apparently, being one of the older factions, the Reptilia  considered experience to be greater than strength. This  made me feel better because for this plan to work I  needed the Reptilia king to be able to see the wisdom of my request. As Augustus prepared to leave I asked him one last  question. “In the King's chamber you first advised me not to touch the Container because I didn't know what it might do to  me. Then later you told me to open it anyway."" ""Which you did, I note."" he said. ""Yes, I didn't really think about it I suppose but why  warn me and then tell me to do it anyway?"" ""The warning was not for your ears. Sharif was near and I wanted him to report to Servus that we believed in the  magic of the Container. Once he had left to make his  report, I knew it was safe to touch the Container."" ""So you don't believe in the magic?"" ""Oh yes I do but I know that this Container doesn't work  like the one you touched at the zoo."" ""Really?"" ""Yes, several copies of the Container were made and  dispatched to the human world with instructions that  any child matching the prophecy was to be given the  box. You'll recall that nothing happened to Titan when  he touched it, only to you."" ""I hadn't thought of that."" I said. ""That's because the magic in those boxes only works for humans not apes. The magic in the Container only  works when it is complete. Once it is complete. Once  the last piece falls into place the magic will work."" ""What will happen to Titan and the others if I succeed?  Will they be stranded on Earth?"" He nodded. ""They always knew it was a one-way ticket.  There are other copies made by other factions too.  Across your world are numerous copies of the Container  waiting for the right child to touch them. Once that child does they would be whisked to the appropriate faction."" ""So in a way it's pure luck that I ended up here?"" ""Probably. I have no doubt that King Sapie will have  placed his own Container copy at the same zoo. It may  be our good fortune that you passed the ape-house  before the reptile-house. Now I must go."" He stood and  placed one large hand on my shoulder. He may have  been old but it was only then I realised he still had  immense strength. ""My lad, you have been a revelation  to me. My one regret is that I will not see you again  when this is over."" ""I will not forget you Augustus and thank you."" He turned and started to leave. Just as he did, he looked back at me and said ""Remember, when the last piece  falls into place. Timing will be everything."" I nodded and he left. -- The next morning I arrived at the throne room. Servus  enquired after Augustus and I simply told him that the  chimp would join us at the battle itself. So we set off for  the battle hall. This involved even more climbing and  swinging. My arms were tired and at one point I thought  I was going to lose my grip. Fortunately a gorilla  grabbed me and swung me onto her back. I clung for  dear life as we swooped and swung across the halls.  Finally we reached the great battle hall and I gasped. The corridor opened into a huge chamber, bigger than a sports stadium and filled with similar seating and stands on either side. The seats and terraces were filled with  an array of creatures: not all of which I recognised. I was escorted by Servus to a boxed seating area on the left.  As I walked I could hear the whooping and cheering stop in an instant to be replaced by muttering, pointing and  then even more noise. At first I was confused by all this  until I realised I was the only human in the room. Eventually I was led to a large platform overlooking one  end of the battle arena. I gazed across the patterned  floor and then looked to the corresponding platform at  the opposite end. There sat a single figure. It was  Augustus who would be acting as general for the  Reptilia. I would do the same for the Simians. Our jobs  would be to direct the battle. I couldn't quite see his  eyes but, as I looked at him, Augustus nodded. A fanfare sounded and through two side doors marched  the warriors for each side. Servus looked proud and  grand leading his army into the arena. Behind him came a large female gorilla, followed by two of the orangutan  advisers I saw at the throne room. These in turn were  followed by two squat chimpanzees and finally two  smaller gorillas. Finally came eight tamarin with long  arms. Beside them came the Reptilia led of course by  Sapie and another - I presumed female - giant tortoise,  then came two velociraptors, two komodo dragons and  two triceratops. At the back of this column came eight  geckos. Servus looked at me and then at my opposing  general. He roared when he saw it was Augustus. “So your treachery really does know no bounds my old  tutor!” he shouted. Augustus simply nodded back. The two sides took their positions, each warrior moving  to their own designated space. A large gong sounded  and a mouse, in elaborate robes, strode, purposefully  into the centre of the battle arena. “This is the last, this is the final. Here it ends!” the  mouse spoke with a surprisingly loud voice. The crowd  stood and cheered. The noise was deafening. The  mouse held up its staff and the crowd hushed itself. “At last we come to these two. On the white side: the  Reptilia!” Another cacophony of noise rose as he said  this. “On the black: we have , the Simians!” The apes  whooped, shrieked and roared. The mouse held its staff  aloft again, when the crowd was quiet, it said “Is the  white general ready?” “I am so!” cried Augustus. A gasp and a whisper went  around the large hall as the crowd realised who he was.  This was nothing in comparison to the silence when the  mouse asked if I was ready. I felt like every single eye in  the room was focussed on me, mostly because it was  true. “Let the battle commence!” said the mouse and it  turned and walked off the arena. I looked at the desk in front of me, on it was a perfect  replica of the battle below. Each warrior represented by  a carved wooden piece and placed in a corresponding  position on a replica of the chequered arena floor. I  glanced at Augustus. As the general on the white side  he would make the first move. This is why the word  “battle” was not really accurate for this event. The two  generals took turns to move warriors into positions  which they believed would gain them an advantage.  There were six class of warriors on each side and each  class was restricted in how they could move across the  floor. As I moved a corresponding piece on my replica  the warrior would move below me. I looked down at my  warriors and as I did Servus caught my eye. He glared  and roared “Do not fail me now boy!” The final part “I just want to go home” “The warriors will be silent!” the mouse shouted from its position on the side of the arena. Beside the mouse lay the  Container,  now  open.  It  had  been  carried  in, suspended on poles, by a gibbon and a oviraptor. Even now the superstition continued. They dare not touch it. Augustus  made  his  first  move,  a  gecko  positioned before Sapie stepped forward. This was not a surprise as every move was planned between us. I made my move and  a tamarin scurried  into place.  We made  several moves each and then I realised it was time to strike. I picked up the piece representing the female gorilla and moved it out. She shuffled forward and looked at me. I knew why. This move left her and Servus exposed. One move from Augustus and Servus himself would be under threat. Augustus  faked  amusement  and  made  his  move.  To everyone’s surprise he mimicked my last move and left Sapie  similarly  exposed.  I  tried  to  look  like  I  was concentrating and moved one of the smaller gorillas. Augustus made his move. We ate in silence. I was somewhat preoccupied with the  task before me and Augustus, realising this, spent most  of his time examining his food in minute detail.  Eventually it was I who broke the stifling silence. ""I know what the Container is.” I said, “I know what I  should do. I can't for the life of me think how I am going  to get the other faction to comply."" I tossed my half- eaten apple to the floor with a sigh. ""That,"" replied my chimp companion, ""was a waste of  good food."" He looked at me and I shrugged. He seemed to study me and then said the last thing I was  expecting. ""Tell me about your family."" ""My family?"" ""I presume you have one?"" ""Yes, yes of course I do. I just don't see how that will  help."" ""Humour and old ape will you?"" I sighed and told him of my parents, of my twin little  sisters and our home. He gestured for me to go on and  so I did, speaking about our daily life and what we get  up to. ""It's funny,"" I said, ""I always quite liked my life  until I came here. Now I see how boring it all is."" ""Boring?"" the ape chuckled, ""My dear human your life is  only boring if you make it so. From what you have told  me, your life sounds full and active."" ""Yes,"" I retorted, ""but not with anything exciting."" ""Exciting does not mean the same thing for everybody. I would imagine your sisters have very different tastes?"" ""That's true."" I said, ""They may be identical but they  could not be more different."" I looked at him, ""What is  the story between you and Servus anyway?"" ""I was his tutor for many years."" the ape started to  smile as he spoke, ""He was always destined to lead the  Simians. Not just because he was born into the right  family but because he had a way about him that made  others listen. The trouble was he was always limited in  his outlook. He had a very narrow view on the world. He  was cautious of the world and eventually that made him paranoid about it. He only ever seemed to want to move one step at a time. I was brought in to broaden his  horizons, teach him to look beyond what was in front of  him. So to speak."" He shrugged. I realised that the more often we spoke the less often I looked on him as an  animal. To me he was just Augustus and it was the most natural thing in the world to hear him speak. ""How long did you tutor him?"" ""Oh about ten years I think. He enjoyed it too. I told him  tales of history and tales of fiction. I showed him how to  think beyond what everyone expected, how to use the  advice of those around him and when not to."" ""So what went wrong?"" ""His mother got sick. He was already King by then and  he had surrounded himself with a host of courtiers and  advisers. The problem was that few of them were in it  for him. They were more interested in their own  position, their own status, their own power. When his  mother got sick, he summoned his advisers, including  me. He was in grief and demanded we advise him how  to save his mother. Of course none of us could do that  because, sadly, she was suffering from an illness  nobody recovers from. The other advisers were too  afraid to tell him the truth and so they told him what he  wanted to hear. They told him she had an outside  chance if he did this or said that."" ""And you didn't?"" He shook his head, ""No. I told him what he needed to  hear - as gently as I could of course. I also  advised him  to spend time with his mother, to enjoy the moments  they still had and make them precious memories. He  got very angry with me, saying I had given up, saying I  was weak. I tried to explain but he started shouting  about his position and the battles. When I repeatedly  told him that the battles were not the future of our  world, he got furious and he threw me out. I have never  been back to his court but occasionally he will ask my  opinion on a prophecy-related matter. Usually my  responses only serve to make him more angry."" ""He seems to get angry a lot."" ""He's never really gotten over the loss of his mother. It's like he thinks he will dishonour her memory if he fails to  become the ultimate ruler of the world."" ""He's that upset about it?"" ""Losing one's queen is a blow to anyone - especially in  this world. This queen in particular was both wonderful  and wise. She had Servus' ability to captivate others but without the limitation Servus placed upon himself. With  her you felt she could and would go anywhere for her  people."" “So Servus has been like this since she died?” Augustus shook his head in sadness ""I don’t think he  has ever felt up to the task of ruling without her."" ""None of this helps me with my task of course."" I said.  Then something occurred to me. ""Before he was king,  did Servus take part in the battles?"" ""Yes.” “Alongside his mother?” “He stood on her right flank."" ""So that means he was..."" I paused, ""Do you think he  was happier in that position or as King?"" ""Oh without a doubt he was happier on the flank. He  preferred to take the battle to the enemy rather than  wait for them to come to him."" ""Even with all his forces to command - ready to fall for  him?"" ""Well, as King he has always wanted to lead from the  front - as his mother did but that's not how it works. By  the time he gets to take part in the battle.."" I interrupted ""He has limited forces left and is somewhat more vulnerable."" ""Exactly."" The ape smiled at me. ""You have a plan, don't  you?"" ""Yes I think we can use that vulnerability to our  advantage. It's risky though and it won't work unless the Reptilia act how I need them to."" Augustus puffed his cheeks, ""You want to speak to their  king? I can do that for you."" “I am hoping you would but I also need something else  from you my friend.” ""Oh so I am your friend, now you want something from  me?"" The greying chimp stared at me and then smiled.  ""I think I like that."" ""You may not like it when you hear what you have to  do."" ""I take it this is something only I can do then?"" ""I'm afraid so. I am also presuming your reputation as  Servus' enemy goes beyond the Simians."" ""Oh I should hope so. I’d be disappointed if it didn’t.” He grinned, “So tell me this plan of yours."" I outlined my thoughts over the next hour or so, fine- tuning them as Augustus told me more about the  Reptilia king. To my surprise he told me the Reptilia  were ruled not by a Tyrannosaur or other fierce-looking  dinosaur but by an old giant tortoise called Sapie.  Apparently, being one of the older factions, the Reptilia  considered experience to be greater than strength. This  made me feel better because for this plan to work I  needed the Reptilia king to be able to see the wisdom of my request. As Augustus prepared to leave I asked him one last  question. “In the King's chamber you first advised me not to touch the Container because I didn't know what it might do to  me. Then later you told me to open it anyway."" ""Which you did, I note."" he said. ""Yes, I didn't really think about it I suppose but why  warn me and then tell me to do it anyway?"" ""The warning was not for your ears. Sharif was near and I wanted him to report to Servus that we believed in the  magic of the Container. Once he had left to make his  report, I knew it was safe to touch the Container."" ""So you don't believe in the magic?"" ""Oh yes I do but I know that this Container doesn't work  like the one you touched at the zoo."" ""Really?"" ""Yes, several copies of the Container were made and  dispatched to the human world with instructions that  any child matching the prophecy was to be given the  box. You'll recall that nothing happened to Titan when  he touched it, only to you."" ""I hadn't thought of that."" I said. ""That's because the magic in those boxes only works for humans not apes. The magic in the Container only  works when it is complete. Once it is complete. Once  the last piece falls into place the magic will work."" ""What will happen to Titan and the others if I succeed?  Will they be stranded on Earth?"" He nodded. ""They always knew it was a one-way ticket.  There are other copies made by other factions too.  Across your world are numerous copies of the Container  waiting for the right child to touch them. Once that child does they would be whisked to the appropriate faction."" ""So in a way it's pure luck that I ended up here?"" ""Probably. I have no doubt that King Sapie will have  placed his own Container copy at the same zoo. It may  be our good fortune that you passed the ape-house  before the reptile-house. Now I must go."" He stood and  placed one large hand on my shoulder. He may have  been old but it was only then I realised he still had  immense strength. ""My lad, you have been a revelation  to me. My one regret is that I will not see you again  when this is over."" ""I will not forget you Augustus and thank you."" He turned and started to leave. Just as he did, he looked back at me and said ""Remember, when the last piece  falls into place. Timing will be everything."" I nodded and he left. -- The next morning I arrived at the throne room. Servus  enquired after Augustus and I simply told him that the  chimp would join us at the battle itself. So we set off for  the battle hall. This involved even more climbing and  swinging. My arms were tired and at one point I thought  I was going to lose my grip. Fortunately a gorilla  grabbed me and swung me onto her back. I clung for  dear life as we swooped and swung across the halls.  Finally we reached the great battle hall and I gasped. The corridor opened into a huge chamber, bigger than a sports stadium and filled with similar seating and stands on either side. The seats and terraces were filled with  an array of creatures: not all of which I recognised. I was escorted by Servus to a boxed seating area on the left.  As I walked I could hear the whooping and cheering stop in an instant to be replaced by muttering, pointing and  then even more noise. At first I was confused by all this  until I realised I was the only human in the room. Eventually I was led to a large platform overlooking one  end of the battle arena. I gazed across the patterned  floor and then looked to the corresponding platform at  the opposite end. There sat a single figure. It was  Augustus who would be acting as general for the  Reptilia. I would do the same for the Simians. Our jobs  would be to direct the battle. I couldn't quite see his  eyes but, as I looked at him, Augustus nodded. A fanfare sounded and through two side doors marched  the warriors for each side. Servus looked proud and  grand leading his army into the arena. Behind him came a large female gorilla, followed by two of the orangutan  advisers I saw at the throne room. These in turn were  followed by two squat chimpanzees and finally two  smaller gorillas. Finally came eight tamarin with long  arms. Beside them came the Reptilia led of course by  Sapie and another - I presumed female - giant tortoise,  then came two velociraptors, two komodo dragons and  two triceratops. At the back of this column came eight  geckos. Servus looked at me and then at my opposing  general. He roared when he saw it was Augustus. “So your treachery really does know no bounds my old  tutor!” he shouted. Augustus simply nodded back. The two sides took their positions, each warrior moving  to their own designated space. A large gong sounded  and a mouse, in elaborate robes, strode, purposefully  into the centre of the battle arena. “This is the last, this is the final. Here it ends!” the  mouse spoke with a surprisingly loud voice. The crowd  stood and cheered. The noise was deafening. The  mouse held up its staff and the crowd hushed itself. “At last we come to these two. On the white side: the  Reptilia!” Another cacophony of noise rose as he said  this. “On the black: we have , the Simians!” The apes  whooped, shrieked and roared. The mouse held its staff  aloft again, when the crowd was quiet, it said “Is the  white general ready?” “I am so!” cried Augustus. A gasp and a whisper went  around the large hall as the crowd realised who he was.  This was nothing in comparison to the silence when the  mouse asked if I was ready. I felt like every single eye in  the room was focussed on me, mostly because it was  true. “Let the battle commence!” said the mouse and it  turned and walked off the arena. I looked at the desk in front of me, on it was a perfect replica of the battle below. Each warrior represented by a carved wooden piece and placed in a corresponding position  on a replica  of the chequered  arena  floor. I glanced at Augustus. As the general on the white side he would make the first move. This is why the word “battle” was not really accurate for this event. The two generals  took  turns  to  move  warriors  into  positions which  they  believed  would  gain  them  an advantage. There were six class of warriors on each side and each class was restricted in how they could move across the floor. As I moved a corresponding piece on my replica the warrior would move below me. I looked down at my warriors and as I did Servus caught my eye. He glared and roared “Do not fail me now boy!” Murmurs started to rise around the room as the smarter spectators began to see where this was heading. They clearly reasoned that  if  we  continued  as  we  were we  would  reach  a stalemate and nobody would win. Move  came  and  move  went.  Some  warriors  were removed  from  the  arena  as  one  of  the  opposing faction’s warriors took their position on the arena floor. There was no bloodshed, just as Augustus has told me. Instead  each  warrior  would  yield  its  position  to  the incoming opposing warrior.  have to say  was amazed at the way this all worked. As each warrior was defeated it and  its  corresponding  carved  wooden  piece  simply disappeared.  Usually  this  was  followed  by  a  rousing chorus of groans from that warriors faction and cheers from the opposition. This was all part of our plan too. In order  to reach our conclusion  we had to reduce  the numbers. Augustus and I made each move to perfection until at last we reached a point where only a handful of warriors remained on each side. The next three moves would be vital. For the reptilia there stood Sapie, a velociraptor and  a  triceratops.  For  the  Simians  there  remained Servus and two tamarind. My forces were dangerously exposed and Servus was extremely unhappy about it. Augustus  could,  if  he  wanted,  defeat  me  within  two moves. I picked up the carved representation of Servus and moved it one place  to the right.  Servus himself huffed and snorted but replicated the move. Augustus moved the  triceratops  into line with Servus,  the two creatures staring at each other across the arena. This was not permitted and I had to use my move to rectify the situation or surrender. I picked up my Servus piece and moved it back to where it had just come from. Again Servus moved on the arena floor. Again Augustus moved the triceratops to be in line with Servus. I slowly moved Servus to the place on his right again. Augustus repeated his move with the triceratops. The crowd grew raucous and the mouse had to step on the arena and raise its staff to silence them. This was it, this next move would bring the end. Slowly I picked up the small, carved Servus and placed it back to the left of where it now stood. The crowd erupted. Some out of confusion, some out of wonder, some out of rage. This was the third time the warriors had been in this exact arrangement. Under the terms of the battle, this meant the battle was a draw. Neither side had won. Servus roared and glared at me. If he could he would have climbed up and attacked me, I’m sure of it. But he didn’t,  he  couldn’t.  All  the  remaining  warriors disappeared  at  once  and even  in  the  ruckus  on  the battle hall everybody  heard the solid “thunk” as the Container closed, signalling the end of the battle. The mouse stepped forward and raised its staff again. The crowd eventually fell silent. The mouse spoke slowly and carefully. “Never in our history has this occurred. The battle is a draw. There is no victor!” The crowd cried out as one but the mouse continued speaking anyway. “The two generals must now join me and we will decide what will happen next.” Augustus  and  I  walked  down to  the  arena  floor and joined  the  mouse,  now  standing  beside  the  closed container. The mouse wrung its paws and looked at us both. “Well?” it said, “What do you plan to do? Shall we have a  rematch,  call  this  battle  void  or  we  can  start  the battles all over again but I warn you the latter will leave us with no ruling faction.” “With respect my lord Geep,” Augustus said, “there is another option. One made possible only by the presence of  my  esteemed  opponent  here.”  The  mouse  looked concerned,  “You are aware of the prophecy?” August asked. “Yes, yes, of course I am!” the mouse spluttered, “but how do you expect us to continue without the battles? There must be battles. We will have anarchy without them!” “That’s not true Geep!” Augustus said and then smiled at the mouse, “My friend, you know as well as I do that in the event of a draw the two generals can elect to stop the battles altogether.” The crowd murmured as they realised what this meant to their way of life. “That law was rescinded years ago!” “No it wasn’t. It was altered so that it may only be used if  one  of  the  generals  was  a  human.  I  presume everybody thought that would be so unlikely that the battles would never be stopped.” The mouse turned to me. “What of you, human? What do you think about all of this.” I took a deep breath and said the lines I had rehearsed. “I see no interest in the continuance of the battles. If my opponent is in agreement I propose we herewith halt all battles.” “I am in agreement.” Augustus said. Try to imagine a large room full of many kinds of animal and bird, totalling hundreds of thousands of creatures. Now  imagine that  each  creature  yelling,  shrieking  or roaring at the top of their lungs. This is what happened when  August  finished  speaking.  I  can’t  blame  them really, what we had just done would change their lives forever. There would be no more battles, which meant no  more  victors,  which  meant  no  more  rulers.  This meant either an end to tyranny for the oppressed or an end to luxury for the oppressors so the noise was either one of joy or anger. Eventually Geep held his staff aloft and quietened them all. “This ruling is permitted but there must be a proposal for how conflict will be settled in place of the battles.” the mouse turned to me. “I propose that copies be made of the replica arenas used by the  generals.  These copies  should be made without  the  capability  to  move  warriors  –  this  is  no longer needed. The copies will be distributed among the factions and when the leader of the faction cannot or will not settle a disagreement, a replica battle – a game –  will  be  played  out  on  these  smaller  versions.  No warriors need be lost. When a conflict arises between two factions then the same type of game will take place between the champions of each faction.” “And the winner of each game is entitled only to what was agreed before the game began!” Augustus added. “Yes.” I concurred. “Those who refuse to abide by this – whether individuals or entire factions – must leave the confines  of  this  world  and  find  solace  in  their  own company elsewhere.” The mouse looked stunned. The room was in silence for what seemed to be ages. Finally the mouse spoke. “This is just.” he said. “What of the rules of these games?” “They will be the same as the battles, each piece will be positioned in the same place at the start of the game. The  white  player  must  go  first  and  each  piece  is restricted  to the same movement  patterns  as in  the battles.”“What do we call this – since they are no longer battles?” a voice came from the crowd. “Where I am from we play this game. We call it chess. I suggest you use that name.” * * * And that was that. The battles had ended and I had indeed brought about the end of tyranny and oppressive rule in that world. The battle had in the end been a huge  game of  chess.  Each  warrior  being  one  of the pieces on a chessboard. Eventually the crowd left and only myself, Geep and Augustus remained. “What will you do now?” Geep asked me. “I want to go home.” I said. He nodded, as did my friend Augustus.“You know how.” Said the greying chimp “and thank you.” He picked up the Container and handed it to me. I took it without thinking and suddenly everything went black. I opened my eyes and cried “No, not yet!” I had not had a chance to reply. The Container had acted as soon as I touched it. “Shh,  it’s  okay.”  a  familiar  voice  said  while  a  hand stroked  my  head.  I  looked  up  into  the  eyes  of  my mother. I was laying on a bed of sorts in a white room with one small window and a couple of chairs. “Where am I?” I asked. “You’re in the recovery room of the medical centre at the zoo.” My Dad replied from behind her. “You passed out. They think it might have been the heat.” “We’re just glad you’re okay.” Mum added. “I  feel  okay  now  just  a  bit  tired.  When  can  we  go home?” I asked. ”Soon as you like.” Dad said, “We’ll have to take you to the Doctor in the morning, just to make sure.” “What about the zoo trip?” “We’ll come another day.” Mum smiled. “Which reminds me. The zoo were concerned about you and have given you a gift. They didn’t need to really. It wasn’t their fault you fainted. They’re just being nice.” “What is it?” “Here.” Dad said and handed me a wooden box which looked very familiar. It looked just like the Container. I opened it and saw an array of carved wooden chess pieces. The white pieces were of various reptiles and the black pieces were all apes or monkeys. I smiled. The top of the box lid had an illustrated title page stuck to it. The title said “Animal chess” and below that it said “Let battle commence!” The photo was of a grumpy but very familiar looking old chimpanzee. “If you don’t like it, we can give it to your cousin,” Dad said, “he likes chess.” “No, I’ll keep hold of it.” I said. “Great. Well if you like I’ll give you a game when we get home.” “That would be good Dad.” I said and stared at the gorilla-shaped King piece nestled in the box. The End ","The story is about a family visiting the zoo when the protagonist is transported to a palace through a wooden object thrown by a gorilla. There, the gorilla and an orangutan believe he may be the prophesied boy who can open the Container, an ancient object holding the fate of their world. The protagonist agrees to help and receives advice from Augustus, a chimp and expert on prophecy, on how to get the king of Simian to comply. The protagonist shares stories of his family with Augustus, who tells the story of how he used to tutor the current king, Servus. The protagonist realizes that Servus may have been happier fighting alongside his mother than as a king.","['zoo', 'chimpanzeefrowned', 'gorilla', 'ape', 'chimpanzee']"
A-Fish-with-a-Wish-FKB-Stories.txt,"                                             A Fish with a Wish   By   Ethan Crownberry                      To my father,   the most honorable man I’ve ever known.   I wish you well…                  Some time ago, in an awfully gray room,  in a corner so dark and so filled up with gloom,  on a table just barely four legs and a plank,  sat one gallon of water in a tiny glass tank.  And inside that water a goldfish was swimming,  pondering glumly the life he was living.  And in that glass tank on that old wobbly table  is where we begin this odd fish-wishy fable.                                                                                  For the fish had been brought home from the pet sto re that day,  and was dropped in his tank in a most unpleasant wa y.  He’d been bought by a man as a gift for his daughte r—  bought with no more than one thin, shiny quarter,  then carried home quickly in a small bag of water.             And now the fish was unhappy. He was far, far from glad.  He was quite disappointed, and growing quite mad.  For the water all around him was cloudy and cold,  and the table beneath him was eighty years old.  “How mean to have put me in such a tight place,”  said the fish with an awful fish frown on his face.   “Thank goodness I’m small and not big like a trout, ”  he huffed one more time as he pouted about.                                                                    His tank was too small; it was quite plain to see.  His tank was much smaller than a fish tank should b e.  There were no fun fish toys, and no fish decoration s,  like shipwrecks that bubble and plastic crustaceans .  There was no ocean backdrop. There were no colored stones.  There were no pirate chests with skulls and crossbo nes.  There were no deep-sea plants, and tree trunks to s wim through.  There was no one to talk to. There was nothing to d o.            “This tank is not fit for a fish to be in,”  said the fish as he tapped on the glass with his fi n.  “Now, I don’t mean to mumble, and don’t mean to moa n.  And I don’t mean to grumble, and don’t mean to groa n.  Please pardon my anger, and pardon my tone,  but…IS ANYONE THERE? AM I HERE ALL ALONE?”                                                                    But no one came running to answer his call.  There was nobody there; there was no one at all.  And the room was as dark as the night was outside.  It was quite hard to see, though he tried and he tr ied.  There was nowhere to go. There was nowhere to hide.   And with nowhere to swim, he was fit to be tied.  He was so sad and lonely he could have just cried.  But the tears wouldn’t come; he was too full of pri de.  It was all he could take; he would not let it slide .  He would not keep the way he felt bottled inside.                    So up from the water the fish popped his head,  and with one giant fish breath the fish loudly said ,  “I am not just some trinket one locks in a case.  I’m a goldfish with needs—I need room—I need space.   I need sunlight, and friends, and clean water, and food,  and a lack of these things is not good for my mood… ”                                                                   “Now, I know that you’re out there, you fish-buying  man,  and I know you can hear me—I know that you can.  Well, this tank is as bad as a fish tank can get,  and one day I’ll get out, and on that, you can bet!   For I feel that my life should hold much more in st ore.  I do not want to stay here—not one minute more.  And I don’t mean to frown, and I don’t mean to pout .  I don’t mean to ramble, and don’t mean to spout.  I don’t mean to yell, and I don’t mean to shout,  but…FOR GOODNESS SAKE, SOMEBODY, PLEASE LET ME OUT! ”             And again no one came. And the fish kept on talking .  He complained and complained, and went on and on sq uawking.  He muttered and whined, but he didn’t stop there;  he niggled and nagged, and continued to blare.  He ranted so loudly that if he had hair,  he’d have pulled every strand ‘til his fish head wa s bare.  He nitpicked and picked, and left nothing to spare,   and at least thirty times shouted, “LIFE ISN’T FAIR !”                                                                      Then all of a sudden, a light shined in his face,  not a light from inside but from deep outer space.  It shined through the window right down in his eyes ,  so fast it had taken him quite by surprise.  He squinted and flinched, and he closed his eyes ti ght,  and he held up his fish fin to block out the light.   He had never seen anything shining so bright,  and had never seen light with such power and might.             “Who’s there?” asked the fish, wondering who it cou ld be.  “Could you please dowse your light? It’s too bright ! I can’t see!”  Then slowly but surely the light faded low  ‘til all that was left was a soft gentle glow.  “What’s this?” said the fish, as he opened each eye .  With his eyes opened wide, he looked up at the sky.   “A star!” he declared. “I know just what I’ll do.  I will wish and I’ll wish ‘til my wishes come true.   I will wish a whole lot. I will wish a whole slew.  I will wish ‘til my fish face turns three shades of  blue.”                                                                            “And what would you wish,” the fish heard the star say,  “if your wishes were granted all night and all day? ”  And the fish nearly jumped back a half-inch or two.   “You can talk!” he said, shocked. “Well, that’s som ething quite new…”            “But as long as you’ve asked, I will tell you my w ish.  I wish I was much more than a measly goldfish.  I wish I could get out of this tank and be free.  I wish I could go swimming somewhere in the sea.  I wish I could go here. I wish I could go there.  I wish I had two wings and could fly in the air.  I wish I could be big. I wish I could be grand.  I wish I had four legs and could walk on dry land.  There are so many things that I wish I could be.  There are so many places I wish I could see.  And if I had my way and could wish a whole lot,  I would wish I was somewhere and something I’m not. ”                                                                          “So what will it be?” the star asked him to choose.   “Just make your first wish. You’ve got nothing to l ose.”  Then the fish started thinking and scratched his fi sh head.  And he scratched and he scratched ‘til his fish fin  turned red.  And he thought and he thought. He thought once and thought twice.  Then, “AH-HA!” he said quickly. “Being a whale migh t be nice!”            And poof! He was there. He was far out to sea.  That ol’ star had come through, and the fish was no w free.  He was swimming in waters so wide and so blue.  He was a great ocean whale. His fish wish had come true.  He was fifty feet long and at least twenty feet wid e,  and was feeling quite strong as he swam through the  tide.  And he swam and he swam. He swam east and swam west .  And he swam without ever once stopping to rest.  Then he dove down real deep. Then he swam up real f ast.  Then he leapt from the surf shouting, “FREE! FREE A T LAST!”                                                                           But then, all at once, a big boat came along,  and the fish knew right then there was something qu ite wrong.  On board there were men who were hunters by trade,  who hunt ocean whales for the wages they’re paid.  Then the captain yelled out to his crewmen, “WHALE- HO!”  And the fish knew right then it was time he should go.              So the fish swam away, and the boat chased him down ,  and through sea and through surf they went ‘round a nd went ‘round.  They went ‘round through Cape Cod, and went half wa y up Maine,  then they turned a sharp right and went half way to  Spain.  Then the men threw their nets, and the fish was now  caught,  and the men pulled and pulled ‘til their nets were quite taut.                                                                              “Are you up there, ol’ star?” the fish cried out in  fear.  “If I may, may I make myself perfectly clear?  Now, I’m not sure you’ve noticed, and not sure you’ ve heard,  but this whale-wish you’ve granted has grown quite absurd.  And if I could please ask you for one more quick wo rd,  could I not be a whale, could I, instead, be a bird ?”                     And poof! He was off. He was high in the sky.  He was flying much higher than most birds could fly .  He was free of those nets and that boat and those m en.  That ol’ star had come through for the fish once ag ain.  He was a great mountain bird. He was soaring so pro ud.  He was flying as high as his bird wings allowed.  And he soared and he soared. He soared left and soa red right.  And he soared past three clouds and two planes and one kite.  Then he climbed, and he climbed. Then he dove down real low.  Then he swooped up as fast as his bird wings would go.                                                                         But far down below him, somewhere on the ground,  a shotgun rang out with a loud shotgun sound.  Then the fish looked straight down and saw somethin g quite grim;  there were hunters with shotguns all aiming at him.   So he flew away fast. Yes, he flew and he flew.  But the next place he flew had more hunters there t oo.  So he flew a bit more. He flew far, far away.  And he searched north and south for a nice place to  stay.  But the next place he flew had much more than befor e;  everywhere that he flew there were hunters galore.                    “Are you up there, ol’ star?” the fish cried out fo r help.  “Now, I don’t mean to yammer, and don’t mean to yel p.  And I don’t mean to be such an ungrateful fish.  And I don’t mean to wish I had not made this wish.  But this bird-wish you’ve granted has grown quite u nfair.  Could I not be a Bird? Could I, instead, be a bear? ”                                                                       And poof! He was there. He had fur and big claws.  But the forest was full of bear traps for his paws…                            So he wished one more wish. He wished he was a cat.   Then along came a bulldog, and that was quite that…                                                                        So he wished one more time. He wished he was a toad .  But he nearly was squashed near the side of the roa d…                So he wished once again. He wished he was a snake.  But the food a snake eats his fish mouth couldn’t t ake…                                                                      And he wished and he wished. He wished he was a mou se.  But he could not run free with a cat in the house.  And he kept making wishes and wishes all night,  but not one single wish of his turned out all right .             Then poof! He was there. He was back in his room.  He was back in his tank. He was back in the gloom. “I give up,” said the star. “I have had quite enoug h.”  “No more wishes for you,” he said, sounding quite g ruff.  “You can not go on wishing like that—it’s not fair.   You can not wish as though you had wishes to spare.   They do not grow on trees, and, in fact, they’re qu ite rare.  You should make only wishes you’ve thought of with care.”                                                                           “Pretty please,” said the fish. “Please with sugar on top.  Could I have one more wish? Then, I promise, I’ll s top.”  And the star listened closely, his patience worn th in,  while the fish begged and begged. Then he finally g ave in.  “I will grant you one more,” said the star to the f ish.  “You may have only one—only one final wish.  But this wish has a price; there is one small conce rn.  For this last wish I grant you, you can not return.   You can not take it back! You can not change your m ind!  This last wish that I grant you, you can not rewind !”           “Fine with me,” said the fish. “On your terms, I ag ree.  And if I may speak, here’s what I’d like to be—”  But the star cut him short with a raise of his hand ,  “Did I not make my point? Do you not understand?  Have you not learned a thing from the things you’ve  been taught?  This last wish that you wish must be given some tho ught.  You can not make it now—you may not wish tonight.  You must ponder this wish ‘til it’s perfectly right .  You must ponder this wish for at least a whole day.   I’ll come back here tomorrow when the sun’s gone aw ay.”                                                                           Then the star disappeared. And the fish closed his eyes.  And the fish slept and slept ‘til the morning sunri se.  Then he yawned and he stretched. He was now wide-aw ake.  He had dreamt half the night of what wish he would make.  Then he peered through the tank, though the room wa s still dim,  and he saw a small girl staring inward at him.                     She was cute as a bug, with blue eyes and big cheek s,  and a giggle that sounds like a squeak when she spe aks.  She had bows in her hair, and had freckles to spare ,  and, beneath her, the fish spied an odd sort of cha ir.  It had wheels on both sides, and two spots for her feet,  and two handles for pushing on the back of the seat .  Then the girl leaned in close, and she grinned ear to ear.  She was quite full of joy. She was quite full of ch eer.  Then she started to speak, and went on for a while.   And little by little, our fish friend grew a smile.                                                                          He did not understand her—not one single word,  but was quite tickled pink by each word that he hea rd.  He was happy to know he was not so alone,  and did not have to stay in that room on his own.  And the day went by quick. And the sun came and wen t.  And the fish was quite pleased with the time they h ad spent.  Then the girl said goodnight as she rolled to her b ed.  And the fish wondered why she had not walked instea d.  Then it dawned on him fast that this girl who can t alk  was a sweet little girl with two legs that can’t wa lk.                   Then it all came so clear. It was all making sense.   “Am I really this dumb? Am I really this dense?”  said the fish. “This poor girl has been trapped her e all day.  She could not go outside. She could not run and pla y.  Now, I’m sure there are places she’d much rather be ,  but she’s trapped in that chair, and she can not br eak free.  This poor girl is a fish! She’s a fish just like me !  She’s a fish in a tank far away from the sea!”                                                                           Then the girl crawled in bed, and she turned off he r light.  And the star, as he promised, reappeared in the nig ht.  “It is time,” said the star. “You may now make your  wish.  And what wish can I grant you, my fine fickle fish? ”  Then the fish went to speak, but he stopped at mid- thought;  with the thoughts he was thinking his face was quit e wrought.  Then he turned toward the girl with a sad sort of s tare.  And he stared at her there. Then he stared at her c hair.  Then he took a deep breath and he sighed ‘cause he knew  the next wish he would wish was the right thing to do.                   Then he turned toward the star, and looked up throu gh his light,  and he said, “Here’s a wish you’ll find perfectly r ight.  Now, you’ve made it quite clear that these wishes a re rare,  and these wishes we wish should be thought of with care.  And this last wish I’m wishing, I don’t have to spa re,  but this last wish I’ll wish is a wish only fair.  So, I’m wishing this wish for that girl over there,   and I wish she can walk and does not need that chai r.”                                                                             And the star smiled and said, “That’s an excellent wish!  That’s the best wish of all ever made by a fish.”  Then he raised his star hand, and he gave it a whir l,  and he cast down his wish granting light on the gir l.  Then the star winked an eye. And the fish was encha nted.  “My fish friend,” the star said, “your fish wish ha s been granted.”               And poof! It had happened. The girl sat up fast.  She could wiggle her toes—she could feel them at la st.  Then she moved both her legs, and she bent both her  knees.  Then she leapt from her bed just as quick as you pl ease.  Then she jumped up and down, and she spun all aroun d.  And the fish was quite pleased at the joy she had f ound.  And the girl was so glad to have legs she could use   that she ran to tell all of her family the news.  And the fish knew right then, out of all he would l ose,  that the wish he had wished was the right wish to c hoose.                                                                   And that’s all there is to this fish-wishy fable.  And the fish, to this day, is still there on that t able.  And the tank he’s still trapped in has not changed at all;  the water’s still cold, and the space is still smal l.  And most times he just stares out the window all da y,  in the hopes that he’ll see his blue-eyed girl at p lay.  And one day, just outside, she had quickly run by,  with a smile on her face, and a gleam in her eye.  And this made him quite happy. He was far, far from  sad.

Kahani_koala_book.txt,"Introduction I watched many videos about koala bears and thought they  were very cute and cuddly animals. So I did some research on  them, and here are some interesting things I found. Marsupials and Koala Bears Marsupials are a branch of mammals. Marsupials stay pregnant for a very short time and have a pouch.  Koala bears stay  pregnant for 30-35 days.  Photo by David Clode on UnsplashThe new born koala bear is called a joey. It weighs half a gram. When born, a joey crawls into its mama’s pouch and feeds on  milk.  At the age of 6 months, he/she starts eating excreted pulpy  eucalyptus leaves called pap prepared by their mother. The joey at age of 7 months emerges from the pouch and rides on its  mothers back.  At the age of 1 year, the joey is kicked out of the tree by its  mother to live independently on its own tree. At this age, the  koala bear has learned to climb trees and eat leaves. Soon these koala bears will become pregnant and repeat the process.  If the joey is a female, it sexually matures at the age of three. If the joey is a male, it sexually matures at the age of four.Why Are koala bears Stuck to Gum Trees? Koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves. Since eucalyptus leaves are  poisonous to most animals, koala bears have it all to  themselves.  Photo by Madeleine Maguire  on UnsplashThe koala bears have big digestive systems, to be able to digest the toxins in the leaves, but even then, the digestive process is  tiring, so they sleep for at least 18-22 hours a day. They eat 500 grams of eucalyptus leaves every day.  Since koala bears get water from eucalyptus leaves, they do not drink any water, but the leaves they eat have to be greenish, not reddish. Koala bears have strong arms, powerful legs, and sharp claws.  They sleep cuddling a eucalyptus tree. The eucalyptus tree is  also called the gum tree.Threats to Koala Bears Picture from wikipedia Koala bears get injured or killed in many ways. 1.Koala bears need eucalyptus trees for their survival, but when we humans cut down large chunks of forests, the  koala bears lose their home. 2.Dogs are koala bear predators..Usually, koala bears and green ants co-exist without a  problem, because the koala bears live at the top, and the green ants live at the bottom, of the eucalyptus trees.  But during droughts and breeding seasons, the koala  bears come down the trees and the green ants leave  formic acid in the koala bear’s eyes, which makes them  blind. But this can be cured. 4.When the koala bears come to the roads, because they  are blind or have lost their homes, some of them may be killed in traffic accidents.  5.Koala bears die in forest fires.Chlamydia Disease  Koala bears get chlamydia from a bacteria called chlamydia  pneumonia . Adult koala bears can catch chlamydia from  sexual transmission, whereas the baby koala bears catch  chlamydia from infected pap. Chlamydia causes the koala bears, painful eye infections,  blindness, bladder infections and infertility. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics. But that upsets the  koala bear’s unique gut bacteria, which they need to help them  digest the toxins in the eucalyptus leaves.Lucky for the koala bears, people are testing a new vaccine for  chlamydia. So far, tests show that if it works, it will  prevent  koala bears from getting chlamydia,  and even if the koala bear  already has got chlamydia, the vaccine will reduce the severity  of the disease.Koala Bear Conservation Because of the various threats to koalas, many of who are  infected with chlamydia, it is important that we humans who  have destroyed their forests, care for them to help their species  survive. The Bee family in Queensland is famous for their koala  hospital. Sick, lost or injured koala bears are brought to the  koala bear hospital called The Magnetic Island Koala Hospital owned by Alison Bee and Tim Bee. They along with their  daughter Izzy, help the sick or injured koalas and nurse them  back to health.  Izzy’s family carefully examine the koala’s injuries and  infections. Izzy feeds the koalas eucalyptus leaves and  manmade powder milk mixed with water. The powder milk  includes the nutrients present in the milk produced by koala  moms.  Izzy rides her bike all over Magnetic Island in Queensland,  searching for large fallen eucalyptus trunks and branches and  takes them to the hospital for the koalas to live on. She gets  fresh leaf for the koalas every day. There are three types of  leaves koalas can eat, so when a new koala comes in, Izzy tries  all three types of leaves to figure out their favorite.Alison Bee is a veterinarian and treats the koalas everyday.  Each koala lives in a cage at the hospital with a fellow koala,  so they can make friends.  At the hospital, the koalas grow to more than nine whole  pounds. Then the koalas are released into a tree selected by  Izzy full of their favorite eucalyptus leaves.  If you want to know more about the way they do it, watch  their show on Netflix called “Izzy’s  Koala World”.","The text is about koala bears, which are marsupials that have a pouch for carrying their young. Koalas give birth to a joey, which weighs half a gram and stays in its mother's pouch for seven months. At six months, the joey starts eating excreted pulpy eucalyptus leaves called pap prepared by their mother. Koalas are unique because they eat eucalyptus leaves, which are poisonous to most animals. They sleep for 18-22 hours a day and eat 500 grams of eucalyptus leaves every day. Koalas have strong arms, powerful legs, and sharp claws. The biggest threat to koalas is habitat loss due to human activity, including cutting down large chunks of forests. They can also get injured or killed by predators, such as dogs or during forest fires. Koalas also suffer from a disease called chlamydia, which causes painful eye infections, blindness, bladder infections, and infertility. However, a new vaccine is being tested to prevent koalas from getting chlamydia or reduce the severity of the disease. To conserve koalas, it is important to care for them, especially those that are sick, lost or injured, and nurse them back to health. The Bee family in Queensland owns the Magnetic Island Koala Hospital, where they take care of sick or injured koalas and nurse them back to health.","['koala', 'koalas', 'marsupials', 'mammals', 'pregnant']"

Tanias-Cycling-Adventure-R-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt,"Tania's Cycling Adventure It was summer. The month of May was unbearably hot in Bombay. So every year during the worst of the sweltering hot weather, Tania and her parents left the city for a week long vacation to a hill station. This year they went to Shimla. Shimla is a hill station in the mighty Himalayan mountain range.Tania and her parents were staying in a resort with sprawling grounds. The area around the hotel was surrounded by lush green cedar and pine forests. The place was indeed very picturesque.Every morning after breakfast and every evening after a scrumptious tea, Tania and her parents wentfor walks in the forests. Mama pointed out pretty flowers of many different colours and sizes. Tania would sometimes spot the flowers before mama and cry out ""Mama, look there is an orange flower."" During the day there was not much for Tania to do. Her parents liked to read, laze, play cards or chat, and that was too boring for the energetic little four year old. The hotel had a children's activity room where Tania had found a pretty pink tricycle. She wanted to ride the tricycle aroundthe hotel grounds. Mama thought it was a good idea and comfortably settled down to read a book on a shady spot on the lawn. She said ""Tania, don't wander off too far away. You may get lost. The grounds are quite big. Stay where I can see you.""Tania was merrily cycling up and down a path in front of the lawn where mama sat. She was a fairly good girl and typically listened to mama. After a few minutes Taniaspotted a squirrel. Tania loved little furry animals. She started riding towards the squirrel. But as she got close thesquirrel started running away. She followed as fast as she could, completely forgetting what mama had said about staying in sight. She saw that the squirrel had stopped near a large tree at a short distance. She got off the cycle and slowly approached the squirrel so as not to startle it. She pulled out a couple of almonds from her pocket and stretched out her hand offering the nuts to the squirrel.The squirrel looked at her suspiciously for a minute. Tania knew she should not get too close or the squirrel would run away again. Cautiously the squirrel started approaching her. Then itsuddenly darted towards her, grabbed the nut and stepped back again. It chomped away on the nut keeping a sharp eye on Tania. Tania waited patiently holding the second nut. Slowly the squirrel began to trust her. He was less skittish when he approached her for the second nut. Tania fed the squirrel a few more nuts and made friends with it. She was happy she had the nuts in her pocket. She had put them there to snack on during the morning walk with her parents. After playing with the squirrel for sometime, Tania got up to getback on her cycle. It was only then that Tania realised that she had never seen this part of the hotel grounds before. She was so intent on following the squirrel that she did not see where she was going. ""Oh, oh!"" she thought, ""Now I am lost."" She decided to cycle along the path for a little while. May be she would see something familiar. In the mean time mama was getting worried. She had not seen Tania in a while. She started looking forher but couldn't find her. The grounds were huge and mama was feeling annoyed with Tania for wandering off. She informed the hotel staff and they sent out a few people in different directions to search for her.As Tania cycled on she came across a fountain. It had a shallow pool of water around it. It was really quaint, and Tania walked up to it for a closer look. She saw a frog in the pool. She was seized withthe desire to touch the frog, so she leaned over the edge of the pool and stretched out her hand. But she slipped, lost her balance and fell in to the pool. Soaking wet and a little bruised, she started crying loudly for mama.Fortunately one of the hotel staff searching for Tania heard her cry. He picked her up and took her too mama. Mama was relieved to seeTania and she gave her a big hug. Then she noticed that Tania was soaking wet. She asked her ""What happened Tania? Where were you, and why are you wet?"". Tania told her everything that had happened. Mama scolded her for wandering off and told her that she could have been badly hurt. Tania apologised and mama hugged her again. Then she carried Tania off to the hotel room to give her a nice warm bath.","a four-year-old girl named Tania who goes on a vacation to Shimla with her parents.

FKB-Kids-Stories-Up-World-Down-World.txt,"Fatima loved Sunday afternoons. After a lunch of beans and kofta, Maa would read the newspaper on her favourite chair and Baba would sneak away to take a nap.Fatima could patter away with her book into the lively green forest near her house. The forest creatures would be sleeping, so it would be just her, curled up in the quiet hug of the forest trees.Fatima would sit down in the shade of the Arjuna tree and gaze into the leafy Up World. Maa had warned her not to climb the tree’s branches. It was safe down below. Fatima didn’t know what was in the scary Up World. But that day, Fatima was in for a surprise. As she turned a page, Fatima felt a dull  THUMP!  on her head.  “Ouch!” she yelled, rubbing her sore head. It was a tiny book, barely the size of a pea.Fatima looked up and saw a furry animal trying to hide behind a bough of leaves.  “Hello! Is this book yours?” she asked, peering into the Up World. But she got no answer.The pea-sized book belonged to Gopa, a young dormouse who lived in the Up World.  Gopa’s little house, made of soft dry leaves and twigs, was in the Arjuna tree as well. The dormouse had often seen Fatima reading, and loved the yellow ribbons in her hair.But Gopa’s Amma had warned her about the terrors of the Down World.  All the animals were fearful of Fatima and other human beings and tried to remain invisible to the Down World.That Sunday, Gopa had been swinging on her green, leafy hammock and reading. She was about to turn the last page when a strong breeze blew the book out of her small, furry paws. Down it went! It bounced on the branches and floated away. The book fell  THWACK!  and hit Fatima on her head. Gopa’s tail quivered and ears twitched. The Up and Down World should never meet, she thought and bolted home.Fatima didn’t climb the tree but kept squinting and trying to read the book. The letters were too small! Finally, she decided to return the book to the shadowy, furry creature. Fatima was really clever – next Sunday she tied five shiny, red balloons around her waist and suddenly, she was floating up. To the Up World!  Up ,  Up , and  Up  went Fatima, until she reached the tree tops.Gopa was brushing her bushy tail when she spotted five, shiny red balloons!  “Oh, balloons! Maybe it is someone’s birthday,” she thought excitedly. But what was this?  There was the girl with the yellow ribbons attached to the shiny, red balloons.  “Run, run away!” squeaked Gopa, “The Down World humans are here!”But Fatima was faster. Fatima offered Gopa the book and asked, “Is this yours?” Gopa grabbed the book quickly and smiled. Fatima giggled. She caught Gopa staring at her ribbons and tied one in a neat bow around her tail. Fatima and Gopa held hands and went off exploring!Fatima and Gopa ran and skipped over the gaps in the trees of the canopy forest.  They bugged Baankey the fruit bat, who was sleeping upside down. Baankey did not like being poked. He grunted grumpily, and flapped away to the next branch.  “These kids will never let me rest,” he thought. Soon he was away in Dreamsville, where he was hanging out in a fig tree, biting into the fleshy, sweet fruits.Gopa helped Fatima hop over the long lines of weaver ants who were too busy to even stop and say hello. With long spindly legs and bubble-shaped bodies, the weaver ants scampered all over the tree.  These ants love teams! They work together to stitch large leaves into cozy nests.Next, they bumped into Firki the canopy frog.  “He looks like a rainbow,” thought Fatima. “Yellow feet, red eyes, and a blue body!” Firki was so surprised to see a human in his canopy that he almost let go of his strong grip on the branch! He croaked a weak hello and turned to pounce on his lunch – a grasshopper!  “I thought only the Down World had frogs,” said Fatima, who loved chasing frogs around her house pond.Hari the Hornbill was watching them from a distance. He really wanted to be friends with them! Hari was a friendly bird but he made very loud noises, which is why some animals kept him at a distance. But Gopa and Fatima didn’t mind at all.“The Up World isn’t so scary after all,” thought Fatima. “How silly I was.” “The people from the Down World are pretty cool,” thought Gopa. “I am not frightened anymore.”“Sob! Sniff.” “Uh, oh, I think Vaidya is crying,” said Gopa.  Her sharp ears picked up sounds easily. The two friends hurried towards Vaidya, a green vine snake, who was very shy.“What is wrong, Vaidya?” asked Gopa. Vaidya sobbed, looking greener than usual. “They cut down the tree that was my home. Now I don’t know where to go,” he cried.  Baankey, Dipu and other animals also popped out of their homes. Vaidya was homeless.  “A new, concrete road is going to be built and humans cut down my tree,” wailed Vaidya. Cutting down their home! The Up World was alarmed and upset.“We must help Vaidya,” said Gopa.  Fatima, Gopa and their new friends formed a search party. They searched and searched and found a snug tree-hole home for Vaidya. Fatima layered the home with soft leaves and orange flowers, Vaidya’s favourite colour. Vaidya loved his new home. “I can’t believe I have so many friends! We need to have a party,” he said.And what a party it was. Everyone got their favourite food. Gopa got nuts, Hari got fruits, Baankey was too sleepy to get anything, the ants brought home-stitched, leafy cushions to sit on! Nobody wanted Firki’s grasshoppers. As for Fatima, she had to get the balloons. For the first time ever, the Up World and the Down World were just One World.Meet Fatima’s Friends in the Up World Gopa and her friends live in the vast forest canopies of India. That means they don’t live in the Down World, like us human beings. Instead they live in the Up World, in the swinging branches and swaying leaves of trees. Many creatures that live in forest canopies are now used to living in tree tops. If you’re lucky you will spot some of them, but most of these animals know how to hide themselves cleverly. So you have to be patient! When scientists go to learn about these canopies, they have to use ropes or ladders, because the trees are very tall. Some even use very large hot-air balloons to get up there. You can imagine just how Up Fatima had to go with her balloons.Here are some of the animals who living in forest canopies: Malabar spiny dormouse:  This bushy-tailed animal likes to live in trees in quiet, undisturbed forests. It loves to eat fruits and nibbles on pepper sometimes. This dormouse sleeps like a hedgehog, curled up with its tail protruding OUT. Hornbill:  These birds are vividly coloured with long and strong beaks. These sociable birds love to eat fruits, insects and even small animals. They make nests in holes in trees and when they have babies, they make a mud wall to cover up the hole, much like making a house!Green vine snake:  A bright green, slender tree snake that hides in the leaves of a canopy. It moves very slowly. You can find them not only in India but also Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Tree frog:  There are several kinds of tree frogs and they come in various colours. They can have white lips or red or yellow eyes and brown feet. They are usually very small, half the size of your palm, because they have to jump around delicate branches. They spend most of their lives up in the trees. Fruit bat (aka Megabat):  They hang upside down. Try to imagine what the world looks like to them! They love to eat fruits and being busy in the trees. They can be super noisy too. You can hear them from a long way off. They have keen senses of sight and smell and are very helpful to us because they pollinate the flowers and fruits we love.This is a Level 3 book for children who are ready to read on their own.

Bobby-Bumbles-Afraid-to-Fly-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt,"                                                        Bobby Bumble’s Afraid to Fly   By   Ethan Crownberry                              To my wife and mother -in -law, bo th of whom I have    used as a human shield against a wayward bee or tw o.                         Little Bobby Bumble was a little Bumble tot,  and Bumble bees can fly,  but Bobby Bumble just could not.                                                                                         He lived quite high above the ground, as far as one  could see,  in a hive that hung from the highest branch of an o lden sycamore tree,  in a hive so very high and safe, as high as a hive could be,  with his brothers, and his sisters, and his mother,  Queen Marie.                           Bobby had so many brothers that he could not name t hem all,  but his favorite three, as young as he, were Johnny , George, and Paul.  They always played together—always four and never m ore;  the rest were just too old for games and really qui te a bore.                                                                         And so we start his story on a beautiful, bright sp ring day,  when Bobby, Johnny, George, and Paul had gone outsi de to play.  They had spent so many days inside, but now the rai n was done;  it was time to leave the hive to have a bit of Bumb le fun.                 And suddenly while playing, Johnny had a wicked tho ught—  a thought so very wicked it was sure to get them ca ught.  He said, “Hey! Do you see the branch right there as  plain as day?  I bet you we can fly there. I’ll go first and lead the way.”                                                                            “We’re not allowed to fly un-watched,” said Bobby i n a huff.  “We’ve only had one lesson and we haven’t learned e nough.  We can fly out on our own after we’ve passed our fl ying test,  but for now, we’re not allowed to go too far beyond  the nest.”  “Oh, don’t be such a baby bee,” said Johnny with a leer.  “It’s probably quite easy, flying there from over h ere.”  “We’re bound to get in trouble,” Bobby said. “We sh ouldn’t go!  One of us could fall down to the ground so far belo w.”                         “I’m going!” stated Johnny. “We have wings! We can not fall!  You can wait here if you’re chicken—if you do not h ave the gall.”  “And what about the two of you?” he said to George and Paul.  “Are you brave enough to try, or are you cowards af ter all?”  “We are surely not as chicken as our little Bobby b ee,”  answered Paul. “Count me in!” added George, who mad e it three.                                                                           And so they started buzzing—started buzzing very fa st,  while Bobby stood there watching—stood there watchi ng quite aghast.  Then they rose into the air and circled over Bobby’ s head.  “You’re a chicky-chick-chick-chicken, baby bee,” th ey meanly said.                   Then off they went, right through the air, without a single care,  the three of them zigzagging and zagzigging here an d there.  They had made it to the branch without a moment lef t to spare.  With wings so very tired, they had made it by a hai r.  Then Johnny yelled, “HEY BOBBY, COME ON OVER IF YOU  DARE!”                                                                                     “If you can do it, so can I,” said Bobby, feeling p ressed to try.  And so he flapped his wings a bit and heaved a heav y sigh.  And with a quiet humming sound, he slowly rose and buzzed around,  wobbling left and right, now quite afraid, but not sure why.  And with a lump stuck in his throat, and all the ha ir up on his coat,  he flew out hardly half an inch when something caug ht his eye...                 That “something” was the ground so very far below t he sky—  far enough to make him dizzy—far enough that he cou ld die.  “IT’S TOO HIGH!” Bobby cried. “OH-ME-OH-MY! IT’S FA R TOO HIGH!”  Then he dropped back on the branch and slumped his head down for a cry,  and wept, “Why, if I’m a Bumble, am I so afraid to fly?”                                                                            Then back inside the hive he went while Johnny laug hed at him,  where he sulked and sulked and sulked and felt so v ery sad and grim.  Bobby hid away for days inside his Bumble honeycomb .  Poor Bobby couldn’t bear to show his face outside h is home…                 …Until the day when Queen Marie had found his hidin g place,  and said, “Hey Bobby, how’d you get that frown upon  your face?”  Bobby said, “I can not fly. I am a washed up Bumble  bee.  I’m afraid of falling down, right to the bottom of the tree.  I think there might be something very, very wrong w ith me.”                                                                                  “That’s quite a problem,” said the Queen, “you have  to overcome,  but you can’t just stay inside all day and be a Bum ble bum.  There are flowers to be pollinated, honey to be mad e;  there is work that needs a-doing; we are Bumble bee s by trade.  Perhaps you need a lesson from the Bumbliest bee of  all.  He can teach you how to fly. He can teach you not t o fall.  His name is Ringo Bumble, and he’s big, just like a  ball.  He’s at least two inches wide. He’s at least two in ches tall.  And if you’d care to visit him, we’ll make a social  call.”                       So off they went, outside the hive, to find this Ri ngo bee.  He wasn’t very hard to spot—not very hard to see.  That Queen Marie just wasn’t kidding when she said how big he was;  he was bumbly, and was bouncy, and was full of Bumb le fuzz.                                                                                     “I have a little matter,” said the Queen, “to put t o rest.  Bobby needs a little coaching—needs to pass his fly ing test.  So take him under your wing and make him Bumbly thr ough and through.  Teach him how to fly, high in the air, the same as you.”                           So Ringo said, “Hop on my back. We’re going for a r ide.”  Bobby did, and, with two handfuls, grabbed the hair  upon his hide.  Then off they went a-buzzing. Ringo hollered, “HANG  ON TIGHT!”  Then they spiraled to the ground with Bobby trembli ng in fright—  with poor Bobby hanging on to Ringo’s scruff with a ll his might.                                                                         Then Ringo took him to a place to teach him all he knew.  He said, “Just listen to me, and I’ll tell you what  to do.”  And then he took him by the hand, and looked him in  the eye,  and said, “This flying stuff is easy. Why, it’s eas ier than pie.  All you really need to know are two important thing s:  Number one: you’re a Bumble.  Number two: you have wings.  And if you bounce as though your Bumble legs are ju st like springs,  you can launch up in the air and let your wings jus t do their things.”                      So Bobby bounced a bit and gave his wings a little flitter.  Then soon his little flitter got so fast it made hi m jitter.  He said, “I think I’m ready now—I’m ready for a try .”  “If you’re ready,” Ringo Bumble said, “then shoot u p toward the sky.”  And with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his e ye,  Bobby catapulted upward, climbing more than two fee t high.  “I CAN DO IT!” shouted Bobby, “I CAN DO IT! I CAN F LY!”                                                                                  But as he hovered over head, something filled him f ull of dread.  Something wasn’t right. He looked around. What coul d it be?  Listening very closely, he could hear, in part but mostly,  a sound that sounded something like a tiny little b ee.  It was Ringo far below him now quite smaller than a  flea,  and looking up so proudly shouting, “THAT A-BOY, BO B-BY!”                  And even though he’d climbed to only two feet, mayb e three,  the height had made him dizzy—made him feel so awfu lly  that his wings just stopped a-buzzing oh-so very su ddenly.  Then Bobby started falling, crying out, “OH-MY-OH-M E!”  Then he hit the ground so hard he nearly broke a Bu mble knee.                                                                         “That wasn’t bad. You did all right,” said Ringo wi th a smile.  “You took off like a pro, and you were airborne for  a while.”  “But I fell,” said Bobby sadly. “I was not supposed  to fall.  I think I’ve got to be the worstest Bumble of them all.”  “Nonsense!” stated Ringo. “I will tell you what you  need.  A little bit more practice would do perfectly indee d.  We will practice everyday. We will come to this her e spot.  I will teach and you will learn, or Ringo Bumble I am not.”                         So Ringo taught, and Bobby learned; they practiced every day.  But Bobby kept on falling in exactly the same way.  “I give up! I can’t do it,” Bobby said with one mor e try.  “I guess as Bumbles go, I was just not meant to fly .”                                                                                     Then Ringo sat him down and calmly took him by the hand.  He said, “I’ve one more thing to tell you, and I ho pe you understand.  If you keep your wings a-buzzing, you will never hi t the ground.  There is magic in your wings and in that humming Bu mble sound.”                        “Magic?” stated Bobby. “I just don’t believe that’s  true.  I don’t believe that such a thing could come from m e or you.”  “And that is why you’re falling,” Ringo Bumble wise ly said.  “You’re not listening to your wings; you’re only li stening to your head.  You’re not afraid of flying; what frightens you is height.  And looking downward seems to lock your Bumble wing s up good and tight.  So remember what I’m telling you, and ponder this t onight:  A Bumble’s always buzzing and their wings are alway s right.  There is magic in our buzzing. Buzzing keeps a bee in flight.  So always keep your wings a-buzzing. Buzz—buzz—buzz  with all your might.”                                                                         And in the morning after, Bobby went out for a walk —  out in the tree to look for Ringo for a little Bumb le talk.  He had pondered Ringo’s words for nearly more than half the night,  and he was curious to see if Ringo Bumble’s words w ere right.  He was ready for his lesson. He was ready for his f light.  But it seemed that Ringo Bumble wasn’t anywhere in sight…                          And as he walked a little further, just a yard or t wo in all,  Bobby came across his Bumble brothers Johnny, Georg e, and Paul.  They were standing there just gawking, all without a single sound.  They had spotted something awful down below along t he ground.                                                                         “What is it?” Bobby asked. “What are you looking at  down there?”  And as he looked where they were looking, something  gave him quite a scare.  It was Ringo being stepped on by a man quite in a h urry,  who was pushing his lawnmower through the grass wit hout a worry.  Ringo never heard him coming; he was off his Bumble  guard.  He was pollinating daisies that had grown up in the  yard.  But the man was not to blame; he didn’t know that h e was there.  There’s no way he could have seen him, to be honest , to be fair.                        “His Bumble wings are broken!” Bobby gasped. “He ca n not fly!  And the mower’s coming ‘round! We must help him or he’ll die!”  “Are you crazy?” stated Johnny. “That is really qui te a haul!  It’s impossible to lift him. And the four of us cou ld fall.”  “Are you chicken?” Bobby asked him, then he looked at George and Paul.  But the three of them just stood there, never answe ring at all.                                                                         “I’m going!” stated Bobby, just as firmly as could be.  “I will save him while the three of you just sit he re in this tree.  I will lift him by myself . I will take him to the hive.  I will save him from the mower. I will help him sta y alive.”  And so Bobby started buzzing—started buzzing very f ast,  while Johnny, George, and Paul stood there watching  quite aghast.  Then he rose into the air and circled over Johnny’s  head,  and though he could have called him names, Bobby he ld his tongue instead.                         Then off he went, right through the air, and headed  for the ground,  with his Bumble wings a-buzzing with a mighty hummi ng sound.  He could see the mower mowing, getting closer by th e inch.  He could see his Ringo Bumble in an awful Bumble pi nch.                                                                                    And in a flash, he was there; he had landed in the yard.  He was standing next to Ringo. His Bumble heart was  beating hard.  Ringo’s fur was quite a mess, and his tail was in a  twist.  He had several broken ribs, and a sprained Bumble w rist.  Not to mention both his wings; we’ll just add them to the list.  There wasn’t any part of Ringo that the man’s foot had missed.                          “You see!” said Ringo proudly. “There is magic afte r all.  You kept your wings a-buzzing, and you flew, you di dn’t fall.”  “But you really shouldn’t be here,” Ringo told him with a moan.  “Save yourself while you can, Bobby. Fly off alone. ”                                                                           There was no time to waste. There was no time to sq uander.  There was no time for thinking or stopping to ponde r.  The mower was close and in moments would pass  and would chop them up both with the weeds and the grass.                  So as fast as he could, Bobby grabbed Ringo’s hand,   firmly planting his feet in the dirt and the sand.  Then he started to buzz, and got ready to fly,  and with a deep Bumble breath he looked up at the s ky,  and said, “Don’t worry, Ringo. I won’t let you die. ”                                                                                  And with the mower at hand, Bobby started to bounce .  He felt lighter than air—just as light as an ounce.   The blades of the mower were as loud as could be.  Oh yes, the mower was close—just an inch less than three.  And with one final spring, he took off like a rocke t,  nearly pulling poor Ringo’s arm out of its socket.  Then up, up he went with a loud buzzing sound  as the mower passed by where they were on the groun d.                Then he climbed and he climbed, holding Ringo’s han d tight,  with his Bumble wings buzzing with Bumble bee might .  They were buzzing so loud—it was all he could hear.   They were humming so high—ringing high in each ear.   And for miles around you could hear it quite clear;   Bobby Bumble had finally conquered his fear.                                                                                  And with Ringo still in tow, Bobby flew back to the  hive.  They were in one Bumble piece, and they had made it  home alive.  And as quickly as he could, the Bumble doctor came to call,  and he fixed up Ringo Bumble in no Bumble time at a ll.  He mended both his wings and put a cast around his wrist,  and said, “I think he’ll be all right now, but I re ally must insist  that for seven solid days—at least one-hundred-sixt y-eight hours,  he must stay inside and not go out to pollinate the  flowers.”                And later, Queen Marie had made it known throughout  the nest  that when it came to flying Bobby Bumble was the be st.  That night she threw a party, and, in front of ever y guest,  she draped a golden medal down across his Bumble ch est.  It was big, and it was shiny, and it bore the Bumbl e crest.  Then she stated proudly, “Bobby Bumble, I’m impress ed.  You have proven that you’re worthy and are far abov e the rest.  And I declare, with flying colors, you have passed your flying test.”                                                                           And in the years that followed no one really could explain  where Bobby got the strength to lift up Ringo like a crane.  Nobody ever knew or even asked the reason why  he was suddenly so brave enough to fly up in the sk y.  Perhaps it was the magic in the buzzing sound he ma de.  Or perhaps the magic buzzing was the spinning mower  blade.  It really didn’t matter what had given him his migh t,  but what mattered most of all was that they made it  home all right.                              And every time he lays his Bumble head down for the  night,  Bobby thinks of Ringo’s words before he shuts his B umble light:  “A Bumble’s always buzzing, and their wings are alw ays right.  There is magic in our buzzing. Buzzing keeps a bee in flight.”  And he never did forget those two important Ringo t hings:  Number one: he’s a Bumble  Number two: he has wings.                                                         ","Little Bobby Bumble is a young bee who lives in a hive at the top of a sycamore tree with his family. He is afraid of flying and often watches his siblings from the safety of the hive. One day, his siblings encourage him to fly with them to a nearby branch, but Bobby is scared and hesitant. Eventually, he tries to fly but becomes paralyzed with fear, causing him to retreat back to the hive and feel ashamed. His mother, Queen Marie, helps him by suggesting he seek guidance from a bee named Ringo Bumble, who is an expert in flying. Bobby agrees and is introduced to Ringo, who teaches him how to fly without falling. With newfound confidence, Bobby goes out into the world and begins to pollinate flowers and make honey like the other bees.","['bobby', 'bumble', 'hive', 'bumbles', 'bee']"
Hero-of-the-Mountain-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt,"The little fox Bubu was very excited. The big contest “Hero of the Mountain” was going to take   place the next day. The bravest and most powerful animals and people were going to take part in it.Bubu wanted to see the contest and meet the most famous heroes in the world. He carefully   studied the map. The contest would take place high on the mountain, on the grounds of the owl- magician, Boran. Bubu was going to have a long trip the next day  . . .That evening, Bubu could not fall asleep till late at night. He was looking at the distant peak,   dreaming about the contest. He was eager for the morning to come.In the morning he woke up early, brushed his teeth and ate his breakfast quickly. He had a long   way to go, so he had a good meal . The breakfast, prepared by his mom, was very delicious.Bubu promised his mom he would be careful and come back before dark , and then he hurried to  the mountain. He passed the meadows, walked around the rocky hills , and suddenly, while   crossing the river, he heard someone screaming for help  . . .Bubu looked around and saw a beetle, who had fallen into the river. The slope of the bank was  too  steep for the little beetle —he couldn’t get out of the river!— and he was waving its legs and   antennae in panic.Bubu looked around for a float or a stick, but he could not find anything useful. As time was   pressing, Bubu sank his tail into the icy water and cried out to the beetle to grab it.In a little while the beetle was lying on the grass, dry ing off in the sun—exhausted but very happy   for being rescued. Bubu was tired as well, but he had no time for rest. He squeezed his tail, which   had become heavy with water , and hurried on to the contest.Soon he saw ahead a little bunny, crying sadly. It had lost one of its gloves and did not know how   to find it.Bubu was in a hurry to get to the contest, but he decided to help the bunny. He lowered his big   sensitive nose to the ground and began sniffing, searching for the bunny’s glove. The bunny   followed him with hope.In a little while Bubu found the glove, fallen aside the path. Nothing can hide from a fox’s nose.  The bunny was very happy and , grinning widely,  hopped home with its gloves on . Bubu hurried to   the mountain.While climbing the steep mountain pat h, Bubu met three fire men-ants carrying a new door for the   ants’ observation post located high  on the mountain—the ants looked for forest fires from there. The door was too heavy and the three ants gasped for breath.Bubu decided to help them, though he was already late for the contest. He took the heavy door   and, together with the ants , carried it up the mountain.Finally they reached the observation post of the firemen-ants and managed , together, to fix the  door in its right place. The ants sat on the ground , tired and satisfied. Bubu was also tired, but   there was no time for rest ; he continued up the path, climbing the peak.When he climbed the peak at last, the contest was over. Broken arrows, targets , and swords were   spread all over the peak meadow  . . . but all the heroes had gone.Bubu sat sadly on the ground. He so much wanted to see the contest and meet the greatest heroes  in the world, but he had  missed everything.Suddenly he heard a flap of wings. He looked up and saw the owl -magician, Boran, alight before   him. “Don’t be sad, Bubu. You did not miss anything so interesting actually. Look, I have something   special for you” and the owl gave Bubu a crystal.  On it was inscribed:  HERO OF THE MOUNTAIN”—it  was the highest-honor award one could receive for the contest! “But . . . why?” asked a very surprised Bubu.  “I have not done any great heroic deed.”  “Is there a greater heroic deed than all the small deeds you have done today?” smiled Boran. “You   missed the contest you so much wanted to see, to help the beetle, the bunny , and the ants. You   are the real hero of the mountain.”Bubu managed to make it back home before dinner and told his parents what had happened.   Everybody at home was pleased and very proud of him.

FKB-kids-stories-dive.txt,"Blue skies and calm waters — a perfect day for diving! We set out in a little boat, hoping for a BIG adventure!When we reached the dive site, we carefully checked all our equipment and put on our fins and masks.As soon as we were underwater, we were greeted by a school of yellowback fusiliers.There were so many different creatures to see  around this large table coral :   oriental sweetlips,  parrotfish , batfish, and even a beautifully-patterned nudibranch. To know more about the creatures marked out in bold lettering, turn to the back section of this book.This trumpetfish changed colour to try and blend in with a school of yellow tang, but you can pick him out easily enough, can’t you?It’s a good thing we kept a safe distance from this lionfish. The spines on his back can be quite poisonous!These  clownfish  carefully guarded their  sea anemone  home, but finally agreed to let me take a few pictures.We saw a honeycomb moray eel having its teeth cleaned by  cleaner wrasses , and another pair even offered to give us a scrub!There were triggerfish and sea urchins.  We even saw a coral grouper and a reef octopus playing hide-and-seek.The octopus won the game. They’re masters of disguise.  Pipefish are great at disguise too. Can you spot the two  ghost pipefish  in this picture?We came across a couple of  whitetip reef sharks  resting near the bottom. They’re pretty harmless, so we swam in for a closer look.We followed this  hawksbill turtle  for a while as he looked around the reef for a nice sea sponge to lunch on.As we made our way back to the boat, we were thrilled to see a  manta ray  ‘flying’ through the water with two remora fish in tow.And just when we thought this dive couldn’t possibly get any better, we sighted a  dugong  grazing on some sea grass.What an incredible experience! I can’t wait to go diving again!Corals  are both plants and animals. Thousands of little algae live inside corals, and give them energy to grow. They have hard outer skeletons and grow into many different shapes. Plankton  is the main source of food for many sea creatures. They are a mix of algae, bacteria, tiny animals, and the eggs and larvae of larger animals that float about with the ocean currents. Feather stars  may look like plants, but they’re really animals. They use their feather-like ‘arms’ to catch and eat bits of floating plankton.Parrotfish  have strong teeth that form a parrot-like beak, which they use to scrape algae off hard coral. Some species don’t mind eating bits of coral as well, and they later poop out a fine sand that washes up on land to form beautiful white beaches.  Clownfish  and  sea anemones  live together and help each other. The clownfish help the anemones by cleaning their tentacles and luring other fish for the anemone to eat. The anemones, in turn, allow the clownfish to hide among their poisonous tentacles without stinging them.  Cleaner wrasses  are small fish that keep bigger fish clean by feeding on their parasites and dead skin. The bigger fish recognise the wrasses by their colours and the dance-like way they move.The  reef octopus  can hide by changing its colour and texture. It makes its home in holes in the reef, or buries  itself in the sand. Ghost pipefish  can be found in pairs, floating with their heads down and hidden among sea grass, corals or feather stars. Like the reef octopus, they can change colour to blend in perfectly. The  whitetip reef shark  has a thin body, broad head, and white tips on its dorsal and tail fin. They hunt at night, and sleep through most of the day.The  hawksbill turtle  has a flat body, a shell with jagged edges, and a sharp, curving mouth that looks like a hawk’s beak.  Manta rays  are huge fish with wing-like fins on the sides of their bodies. These large fins help them swim gracefully through the water. On some manta rays, the distance from one wing tip to the other can reach up to 23 feet!  The  dugong  is a vegetarian marine mammal. Its favourite food is sea grass, which it is able to graze on with its  specially-shaped snout. Dugongs are also called sea cows.This is a Level 3 book for children who are ready to read on their own. (English) DIVE!

FKB-Stories-Mystic-Moon-Saves-the-Day-F-Meintjies.txt,"Mystic Moon wandered the Magaliesberg hills for man y days and  many months. In this time, he had seen no other wol ves. He had  come across some lions but kept his distance. Now a nd again they  growled at him from a distance as he moved between the age-old  brown rocks and the vegetation − bushes, grass, wild flowers.  At  other times, careful to stay downwind, he came clos e to the lions,  just watching them and getting to  know the other animals in the area.  He loved climbing to the crest in the  afternoon light.   Up there, he could feel the cooling  air, sometimes gusting and  sometimes gentle. He could see far  into the distance  the grasslands  far away and here and there a human dwelling. Somet imes when the  wind pushed hard, it caused tears in his eyes. But he was at peace  here, finding a stillness in himself.  One day he noticed two young lions playing on the h illside, moving  higher and higher up in the folds between the crag.  His eyes drifted  to some eagles circling a few miles west. He also s aw a few grey  clouds drifting in and wondered if rain would come.  When he turned  back to look at the cubs, they were perched on a na rrow ledge.  Below them, the valley fell away, hundreds of feet.  He could see no  adult lions nearby.   Before the cubs the small stone walkway  continued for a bit; then it ended in a  sheer rock-face. Above them, the rocks  perched precariously. He watched as one  of them tried to walk backwards, but its   paws fumbled on loose stones and the young lion fro ze. One jump  away was a flat rock that again opened up to the bu shes on the  incline. Mystic Moon bounded down along a path, get ting close to  the pair. ""Hey kids,"" he said.   The cubs dared not look up. He heard one call out: ""Hey, hello  ....  where are you, who are you?"" .  Then the other's voice trembled: ""P..p..please help  us!"".   The wolf said: ""I am Mystic Moon. Don't look up. J ust stay calm. I am  coming to help.""  Just then Mystic Moon heard a loud  growl. He looked down. It was the  lion he knew as Matseng. A few steps  behind him was Cleo, a lioness that  the wolf had seen a few times with  Matseng and his brother Zukhara.   ""Keep away from them,"" Matseng  roared again. ""Yes you, wolf!""  In the  silence of the mountain, it was like  thunder in the wolf's ears.   Mystic Moon looked at them. Normally he feared lion s, especially  since they hunted in a pack; but his concern for th e cubs made him  stand his ground. He walked onto a small rock neare r the edge:  ""Matseng, I come in peace."" he said. ""We have had o ur differences. I  know you are fussy about who comes into your huntin g grounds. But  this is no time for that. Can't you see your little  ones are in trouble.""   Matseng roared again.     But Cleo intervened, moving to stand in front of Ma tseng and looking  into the big lion's face. Mystic Moon waited patien tly. He could feel  the wind building up. One of the cubs, the darker b rown one with a  some black hairs on the ridge of the back, slipped and small pieces of  stone went raining down and landed on a small outcr op halfway  down. Mystic Moon couldn't hear what Cleo was sayin g to Matseng.  Now and again Matseng let off a soft growl that pet ered out.   Mystic Moon called out: ""You will never reach them in time. Let me  help them"". One of the cubs whimpered and a blast o f wind whistled  through the grass and rocks.  ""Fine,"" Matseng said, looking up at Moon and at the  cubs. ""Just this  once. Because you are up there. And we have nothing  to lose by  letting you help them."" Cleo stepped to the side an d joined Matseng  in looking up at the brown rocks and the three anim als up there.  Matseng's ears were up and directed slightly forwar d; his tail pointed  up. He leaned forward on his forelegs. It struck My stic Moon that  Matseng was as worried as Cleo, although he tried t o hide it.  Mystic Moon jumped down to a spot in front of the c ubs. He grabbed  one at the scruff of the neck. Then, after measurin g the distance with  his eyes, leapt across the crevice to a flat rock a cross. He put the one  youngster down and went back for the other one.    When both cubs were on the  other side, the wolf led them and  said. ""Come, follow me. I know  an easy way down."" He first  climbed up higher to pass a  spring before making a turn to a  path on the other side of the  gully and its sticky mud. The cubs  followed him. ""I am Mystic  Moon, a wolf,"" he said as he  waited along the path for the cubs to catch up. ""My  mother gave me  that name because the moon had a strange reddish co lour the night I  was born"".  ""Thank you, we were so scared,"" said the tawny cub.  ""I wasn't,"" said  the brown youngster with sprinkles of black hair on  the back of his  neck. Mystic Moon replied: ""If you say so, but it i s no shame to feel  scared,""  He noticed the young lion lifting himself  higher on his  forelegs and raising his tail. ""Truly, I wasn't. By  the way, my name is  Little Warrior,"" the cub said.  Moon shepherded the cubs down the pathway. Halfway down,  Moon stopped and the cubs brushed past him on the p ath before  also coming to a stop. Moon could see Matseng pacin g slowly down  below. Cleo was resting on her forepaws on a small mound. But she  kept her eyes focused on the hillside.  Mystic Moon called out, ""Here they are, Matseng and  Cleo!” He  turned and made his way back up the mountain.   He heard Cleo roar. It sounded like a friendly roa r. He heard the light  brown cub call out: ""Thank you for helping us, mist er Wolf"".  He turned to glance back briefly, nodding his head.  Then he  continued to climb. The wind had blown many more cl ouds over this  part of the Magaliesberg mountains; they hung low. It was going to  rain for sure. Mystic Moon picked his way from ston e to stone and  between the bushes, heading towards his cosy den hi gher up.

TheGreenChicken_en-FKB.txt,"In the corner of the farmyard, two eggs lay on a pile of straw.  The mother hen sat on them all day and got up  only to drink water and eat something in a hurry.  One day a strange big egg rolled down from  the hill next to the farm, it came under the fence  and stopped right next to the nest with the two eggs.  “Hey! Someone dropped their egg!” cried the hen.      “Come and take it quickly before it cools down!”        Nobody answered. There was no one on the hill.

Their mother rushed  to save them, but the fox  grabbed her by the throat.

""I need one more because I am  expecting guests tomorrow.  Any volunteer s?” ""Take whoever you want,"" said the rooster cowardly, ""but it's best to get some   little chicken with tender meat . You won’t want me, I am very chewy .”  ""Okay ... I'm  going to get  ... I'm going to get… "" the fox began to wonder.   At that moment the fo x heard something behind him. It was Chop:  “Let them go! ” “Aaaaaaa! ” cried  the fox and dropped his prey . “Noooo … My tail!” “You want one more chicken ? Here I am! ” Chop gritted his teeth .  “I changed my mind !” said the fox. “ I don't want chickens anymore. Please let  me go. It is so painful …” ""I don’t want to see you ever again! "" Chop said, still biting the fox’s  tail.  ""I promise! I will not set foot here again. Just let me go .”Chop opened his mouth and the fox ran away .  Chick, Chip and their mother rose from the ground, still frightened but unharmed. ""Wow... That was amazing! "" Chip shouted, catching his breath. "" You almost bit  his tail off!

I believed in my own strengths and nurtured my natural talent. I improved my weaknesses. And above all, I always followed my heart”—Tine Mena, mountaineer 2/20Today is a big day for Tine Mena. At the age of 25, she has become the first woman from Northeast India to climb Everest. At 8,848 metres, Everest is the highest mountain in the world. It’s as high as five thousandmen (who are six feet tall) standing on top of each other!This is the story of Tine’s journey, a girl who loves to climb mountains. 3/20Whooshoo! Whooshoo!In the Mishmi hills of Arunachal Pradesh, Tine heard a wondrous call from the distant mountains. She was drawn to it, a sound only she could hear. 4/20Tine loved to climb. She climbed trees, ran through the jungle and went fishing in the river. She wasas fearless and strong as Naaya, her grandmother. If Tine fell down, Naaba, her father, would tell herto get up and carry on. 5/20Tine and her younger sister Sony loved eating apples, oranges,and berries from the forest. They spent long days lying underthe sun. Ah, Tine would smile, what a wonderful life! 6/20But one day, Tine’s worldturned upside down. Therewas no school in Echali, soher family moved to theclosest big town, Roing.There, the ‘Whooshoo’became a faint whisper. Allshe wanted was to be in themountains. 7/20Ten years later, Tine finished school. The mountain call was strong again - whoshooo, whoshooo. 8/20To be close to her mountains, Tine applied to be a porter for anarmy expedition. She could carry heavy loads and march for days,shoulder to shoulder with others. But there was one smallproblem—women were not allowed to be porters.But did that stop her? Of course it didn’t! Tine dressed as a boyand began working. She’d carry nearly 25 kilos every day. It tooka week for everyone to realise that she was a girl disguised as a boy! 9/20Tine was scolded for breaking the rules. But she could work as much as the boys and knew the routebetter than anyone. So the officers agreed to let her continue working. Her act would later help liftthe ban on female porters.10/20Tine worked hard andbecame a coordinator,someone who plansmountain trips. That’s whenshe met Dr. Romeo Meitei,the leader of an expedition.“I must say that you have allthe makings of a naturallygifted climber,” he said.“You have the build, thestrength, and thedetermination. Now all youneed, is technique.”Dr. Meitei became hermentor and Tine began hertraining. 11/20But it was when Tine saw The Race for Everest, a film about the first climb of Mount Everest, that she heard about her dream mountain. The Whooshoo became a roar. Climbing Mount Everest became Tine’s dream. 12/20Finally, Tine left for Nepal. She was anxious, but determined. At the Everest base camp, it was coldand the air, thin. After her training, Tine began her climb with Cherring Sherpa*. The climb was divided into four sections so climbers could rest at different camping points andcontinue to the top over a few days. By the time Tine and Cherring Sherpa reached the second camp,the weather had worsened.*Sherpas are a Tibetan ethnic group living in high Himalayan regions who are known for their climbing skills. 13/20But the musicalWhooooshooing wasalso growing louder andhypnotic!“Do you want to go ahead?”Cherring asked.“I don’t think I will getanother chance to do this,”Tine said. 14/20Somehow, they reached their final camp.But the wind blew their tent and supplies away.They found another tent in which they took shelter. No walkie-talkies, no medicines, all Tine and Cherring had was a packet of noodles. 15/20“Let’s share half of it,” Cherring suggested.“If we make it alive, we will eat the other half,” Tine said with a determined smile.For every two steps they took, the wind sent them reeling back a step. The stormy winds howled, “Go awayyyyy”. But Tine could only hear “Whoooshoooo”. 16/20With new resolve, theyfearlessly began the lastpush to reach the top. 17/20At 10.45 am on May 9, 2011, Tine summited the highest mountain in the world.

FKB-kids-books-The-story-of-stories.txt,"It was a beautiful summer day in the Forest-By-The-Sea in the glorious land of Somewheristan. Whales danced in the waves, singing to each other. Sea lions, their smooth brown bodies glistening in the sun, played peek-a-boo with the noisy seagulls, barking and scolding.  Every creature in the Forest was happy, happy, happy .Excuse me! you say. That can’t be true. There’s NEVER a time when EVERY creature ANYwhere is happy, happy, happy .   Hmmm. Maybe you’re right. Maybe not EVERY creature was happy. This journalist bear, for instance.  In this picture, Bear is trying to smile, but he has a great sorrow. He simply cannot find a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story. He even sent Bird to look - because Bird moves faster and sees better - but Bird came back with nothing.‘BREAKING NEWS’ stories are about anger and fear and hate and greed, and there was none of that in the Forest. Everything was  happy, happy, happy .   A journalist bear without a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story doesn’t deserve to be a journalist bear, thought Bear sadly to himself. He should be a Waiter Bear, or a Sweeper Bear, or a Telephone Voice Bear, saying, ‘Please check the number you have dialled’, or ‘Kindly wait - you are in a queue’.He packed his things and started walking to the bus-stop, when Singing Sardarji popped out from behind a tree.“Arrey oh Journalist Bear!” said Sardarji. “Going somewhere?”  “Don’t call me that or I will cry,” said Bear, and told Sardarji he was leaving to become a Telephone Voice Bear.   “Don’t be such a silly bear, Bear!” scolded Sardarji. He pulled out a guitar and began to sing. “If Tweety birds stop tweeting,  and Hooty Owls stop hooting,  the world would be a sad playyyy-ce,  don’t you see?”“Don’t you seeeeeeee?” sang the Tweety Birds and the Hooty Owls.   “If Singing Sardarjis don’t,  and Journalist Bears won’t,  the world would be a bad playyyyy-ce, don’t you see?” sang Sardarji.“I do enjoy being a Journalist Bear,” Bear said sadly. “I do love finding out things, and talking to people, and writing their stories, but I also do NOT have a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story, which means...”   ‘A-HA!’ said Singing Sardarji. “What?” said Bear, puzzled.  “You like finding out things! And talking to people! And writing their stories! You are a Journalist Bear, Bear, but you have the soul of a... drumroll please... Writer Bear!”Bear beamed. Sardarji was right! He really WAS a Writer Bear.   “Tell you what, Bear,” Sardarji went on, “let’s travel the world, you and I. I will sing, and you, Bear, will write. Not 'BREAKING NEWS' stories - no one remembers those after three days, anyway - but real stories of real people, stories that will never grow old.”   “Hurray!” said Bear.And that was how Writer Bear and Singing Sardarji set out to explore the world.  Everywhere they went, Sardarji sang to the people, and Bear listened to them. Over time, Bear wrote many, many stories. Happy stories that made people cry, funny stories that made them think, sad stories that made them hope, and scary stories that made them laugh.   And Storyweavers all over the world picked up the long, strong, shining threads of Bear's stories, and wove them into new and wonderful stories for all of us to enjoy.#6FrameStoryChallenge: A Carnival of Art The illustrations in this book were created as part of the #6FrameStoryChallenge, an online campaign run by Pratham Books to build a rich bank of illustrations for StoryWeaver.

dinosaurs-ucedu-FKB.txt,"THIS IS THE FIRST OF 3 PAGES THAT HELP TO PUT THE 165 MILLION YEAR REIGN OF  THE DINOSAURS, IN PERSPECTIVE. IT IS A CALENDAR THAT IS DESIGNED SO THAT ALL OF THE TIME, SINCE THE BIG  BANG HAPPENED –13.8 BILLION YEAR AGO, UP TO THE  PRESENT TIME, IS COMPRESSED INTO 1 YEAR.  First  Dinosaurs Dinosaurs lived for 165 million years !! Humans have only existed for  0.004% of  the age of the Earth !periodThe rocks of the Cincinnatian series  were deposited between  approximately 451 and 443 million  years ago, during the Ordovician  period, when all the land was  underwater !BASIC DINOSAUR FACTS •Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that have lived  on Earth for about 165 million years.  About 60% of dinosaurs ate plants (herbivores)  and 40% ate meat (carnivores) •In 1842, the English naturalist Sir Richard Owen coined  the term Dinosauria, derived from the Greek deinos ,  meaning “fearfully great,” and sauros , meaning “lizard.” •Dinosaur fossils have been found on all 7 continents. •All non -avian (non -bird) dinosaurs went extinct  about 66 million years ago (MYA). •There are roughly 700 known species of extinct  dinosaurs. •Modern birds are a kind of dinosaur because they share  a common ancestor with non -avian dinosaurs. The Archosaurs consist of a diverse group of  Triassic living and  extinct reptiles  that are  subdivided into    crocodiles, the       2 main types of  dinosaurs, and  pterosaurs.ORNITHISCHIAN AND  SAURISCHIAN DINOSAURS As shown on the previous diagram, there  are 2 types of Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs and reptiles have hip girdles,  orpelvises , and all of them are composed  of three bones: the ilium, ischium, and  pubis.  All ornithischians are united by a  pubis pointing backward, running  parallel with the ischium.  The name ""Ornithischia"" means ""bird - hipped,"" and birds also have pelvises in  which the pubis points backwards.  However, birds are more closely  related to the Saurischia, or ""lizard - hipped"" dinosaurs, than to the  ornithischian dinosaurs.As shown above, the  pubis bone in the  Saurischian dinosaurs points  forward .   necksDINOSAURS Dinosaurs first appeared during the Triassic  period, between 243 and 233.23 million  years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial  reptiles throughout the Jurassic and  Cretaceous periods.  The fossil record demonstrates that  birds are modern feathered dinosaurs  because they evolved from ones that  lived during the Late Jurassic period.  So birds were the only dinosaur  lineage to survive the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event,  approximately 66 million years ago. Time of the DinosaursDinosaurs lived  during the Mesozoic  time period, for 165  million years. This was during the  Triassic, Jurassic,  and Cretaceous time  periods. The Mesozoic was  described as the  “Age of the Reptiles”THE AGE OF REPTILES The Mesozoic is an era that started at 252.2 million years ago to 65.5 million years ago,  and is composed of the Triassic Period, the Jurassic Period, and the Cretaceous  Period. The Mesozoic was a place of giants, with dinosaurs ruling the world.  They first evolved from Archosaurs into dinosaurs during the Triassic Period, turned larger  and more diverse in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, but got wiped out by the  Cretaceous –Paleogene (K –Pg) extinction event, at the end of the Cretaceous period. THE 2 MAIN PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS  OF DINOSAURS Archosaur ankles: The two major groups of  archosaurs are distinguished by differences in the  joint of their ankle.  The crocodiles and their relatives have an ankle  joint (at left), while dinosaurs and pterosaurs  (flying reptiles) have an ankle joint (at right).  The red line in each image shows the plane of the  ankle hinge.  THE CINCINNATIAN TIME PERIOD The Cincinnati area was under an inland sea for millions  of years, during the Ordovician period (485 –443 MYA)  and there was all kinds of underwater life at that time  but it was before there were any fish here.   The Cincinnatian layer is in the Ordovician period range  and was here 451 to 443 MYA.  This is why it is such a  good fossil hunting area. People who study the history of animals and fossils are called Paleontologists.  As part of their  training, they are asked to remember all of the names of the different time periods . A mnemonic is a shortcut way to remember things like this and one of those used for this set,  starting with the Cambrian period is: “Cows Often Sit Down Carefully. Perhaps, Their Joints Creak? Please, No Questions”This graph shows  the changes in the  Carbon Dioxide in  the air, during the  various time  periods. Notice that it  peaked during the  Cambrian period  and was still  somewhat high  during the Triassic,  Jurassic, and  Cretaceous  periods, when the  Dinosaurs lived.EARTH'S MAGNETOSPHERE ALLOWS  US TO HAVE AN ATMOSPHERE Life on Earth initially developed and  continues to be sustained under the  protection of this magnetic environment. Themagnetosphere shields our home  planet from solar and cosmic particle  radiation, as well as erosion of  theatmosphere by the solar wind -the  constant flow of charged particles  streaming off the sun.  Early Earth had a low -oxygen  atmosphere created by volcanic  gases. The Great Oxygenation Event  (GOE) responsible for rise in  Oxygen levels, which occurred  nearly 2.3 billion years ago, is  essential for all of the Life on  Earth today.    It was the result of the growth of  plants that took in Carbon Dioxide  and released Oxygen. Algae and microbial mats of plant material  produce Oxygen and take in Carbon  Dioxide for their growth process.STROMATOLITES UNDER THE  OCEAN  Stromatolites and microbial mats are diverse and complex ecosystems  where different species of bacteria  and other microbes work  together to produce oxygen. They have been around and  growing for 3 billion years ago.  They are only found to a depth of 4  meters because some of the microbes  forming them, cyanobacteria, require  sunlight. .2 –199.6 MILLION YEARS AGO  (MYA)  THE TRIASSIC PERIOD 200 million years ago, dinosaurs roamed the  supercontinent Pangea which extended from pole  to pole, surrounded  by the Pantha -lassic Ocean ,  the oceanic ancestor of the Pacific Ocean. ❖At the end of the Triassic era, 80% of species  died. ❖Pangea supercontinent combines all major  landmasses ❖Panthalassa combines all oceans except Tethys ❖The climate was very hot and dry with huge  deserts at the center of the land mass. ❖Archosaurs wildly diversify, becoming the  crocodilians, the flying Pterosaurs, and  Dinosaurs. It is  interesting  to note that  before  Pangea  started to  break apart,  the lower  part of  North  America  was at the  Equator !!Ancient fossils of the same  species of extinct plants and  animals are found in rocks of  the same age but are on  continents that are now widely  separated .  Alfred Wegener proposed that  the organisms had lived side  by side, but that the lands had  moved apart after they were  dead and fossilized.  He suggested that the  organisms would not have  been able to travel across the  oceans. Wegener used fossil evidence to support his  continental drift hypothesis. The fossils of these  organisms are found on lands that are now far  apart.THE MESOZOIC ERA The Mesozoic era includes the 3 main time  periods when the Dinosaurs lived: 1)Triassic 2)Jurassic 3)Cretaceous. As the Mesozoic era begins, we see the rise  of the dinosaurs, during the later part of the  Triassic Era which is 252-201Million Years  Ago so it lasted for 51 million years. Pterosaurs (flying reptiles) also made their first  appearance here as well as frogs, turtles, and  crocodiles.  During the Late Triassic period, many small  mammals also arose.THE TRIASSIC PERIOD As mentioned, the Triassic period - spans almost 151 million years.   It began in the wake of the  Permian –Triassic extinction event,  which left the Earth's biosphere in  bad shape.   It was well into the middle of  the Triassic before life  recovered its former diversity.  A specialized subgroup of  archosaurs, called dinosaurs,  first appeared in the Late  Triassic but did not become  dominant until the succeeding  Jurassic Period. PLEUROMEIA TREES After the big Permian -Triassic  extinction when most plants  died out, these trees grew  everywhere around the world  during the Triassic period .    It was a smaller tree with a  single, unbranched trunk  topped by a tuft of grass -like  leaves, with one or 2 side  cones and a main one at the  top.   It reproduced from spores in  the cone at the top of the tree.PLANTS THAT  LIVED DURING  THE TRIASSIC  PERIOD The environment  was dominated  by conifers  (evergreen  trees), ferns and  a now -extinct  group of plants  known as the  seed ferns. Most ferns did  and still  reproduce with  small packets of  spores on the  under side of  their leaves.  Nyasasaurus  parringtoni This dinosaur is believed  to be the one of the first  ones that walked the  Earth about 243 million  years ago, during the  Triassic period . There were probably  others similar to it that  lived before then, but  their fossils haven’t been  found yet. The video of the dinosaur  Troodon is shown, which  is very close in size to  Nyasasauruas . COELOPHYSIS One of the first true dinosaurs in  the Triassic period was Coelophysis  (""hollow form""), a carnivorous,  bipedal predator that emerged in  the late Triassic, between 225  and 220 Million years ago  (MYA).  With Hollow bones, it grew up to  10 feet in length, weighed around  60 pounds and probably fed on  smaller reptiles and amphibians. It had curved claws on its hands  and a slim head crammed full of  very sharp teeth. HERRERASAURUS Found in the late Triassic  period in  northwestern  Argentina, Herrerasaurus is an early archosaur  which is the main  classification for  dinosaurs.  The first specimen was  found in 1958 by  Victorino Herrera, for  whom the fossil was  named.  It was a large carnivore  about 20 feet  long and  they weighed up to 770  pounds. OTHER  TRIASSIC  DINOSAURS As mentioned,  dinosaurs  didn’t start to  appear until  the end of the  Triassic period. These are  some others  that lived at  that time. CHINDESAURUS STAURIKOSAURUS EORAPTOR COLORADISAURUS LILLIENSTERNUS LYCORNISMELANOROSAURUS MUSSAURUSThe Jurassic period began the Age of the  Ruling Reptiles, 208 -144 Million Years Ago.  During this period, vegetation was greener  and more abundant.  By the Late Jurassic, huge dinosaurs such  asStegosaurus, Ceratosaurus,  Brachiosauru s, and Allosaurus walked the  lands.  Flying reptiles ruled the skies.  The earliest known birds also appeared.WILLIAMSONIA PLANTS Williamsonia was a significant  plant during the Jurrasic time  period. It possessed a sturdy stem and  had multiple fern -like leaves.  The plant did not live in groups. They produced flowers up to 4  inches in length. Its stalked seeds would have  grown from a central  receptacle, and the entire  flowers would each have been  surrounded by protective  coverings.By the beginning of the  Jurassic, the  supercontinent Pangaea  had begun dividing into 2  landmasses: Laurasia to  the north, and Gondwana  to the south. This created more  coastlines and shifted the  continental climate from  dry to humid, and many of  the arid deserts of the  Triassic were replaced by  lush rainforests. COMPSOGINATHUS It was one of the smallest  carnivore (meat -eating)  dinosaurs.  It caught and  ate small animals,  including insects and  lizards. It was 4.6 feet long, 10  inches tall, and weighed  6.5 pounds It lived during the Jurassic  period, about 155 to 145  years ago. DILOPHOSAURUS It lived in Arizona during the  Early Jurassic, about 193  million years ago.  It’sname means ""two -crested  lizard as it had a frill collar it  could expand to scare a  potential enemy.  It also had  small feathers around its  body. It was 23 feet long and  weighed about 880 pounds.   The one in the video is a  smaller size. It was one of the earliest large  predatory dinosaurs and the  largest known land -animal in  North America at the time. DRYOSAURUS Dryosaurus  which means  tree lizard, lived  in forests in the  Western United  States in the  late Jurassic  period. They were 8 to  14 feet long and  weighed up to  170 to 200  pounds. HUAYANGOSAURUS It lived around 165 million  years ago, some 20 million  years before its famous  relative, Stegosaurus  appeared in North America.  It grew up to 15 feet  long  and weighed 1,000 pounds.  On its neck, back, and tail  were two rows of paired  small vertical plates and  spikes. On the rear of the  tail, pairs of spikes were  present forming the so - called ""thagomizer "", a  defensive weapon which  was on all of the dinosaurs  in the Stegosaur family.GIGANTSPINOSAURUS Gigantspinosaurus meaning  ""giant -spined lizard"" is a herbivorous  dinosaur from  the Late Jurassic period.  It is another member of the  Stegosaur family that was  found in China. KENTROSAURUS They lived in the  Late Jurassic  period, in   Tanzania, about  152 million years  ago. They grew to  15feet long and  weighed about 1.1  tons. CHUNGKINGOSAURUS Chungkingosaurus ,  meaning ""Chongqing  Lizard"", is aherbivorous  dinosaur from the Late  Jurassic period, in   China.  It is a member of the  Stegosaurus family of  dinosaurs. STEGOSAURUS They lived in the late  Jurassic period,  between 155 and 150  million years ago, in  the western United  States and Portugal. They grew up to 29.5  feet long and weighed  up to 7.7 tons. It and the 4 dinosaurs  shown previously are  all in the Stegosauridie family, shown on the  next slide. FIGHT BETWEEN A  VELOCIRAPTOR AND A  PROTOCERATOPS They will remain forever locked in  mortal combat. The Velociraptor has  sunk its deadly foot claw deep into  the neck of the herbivore, a boar - sized creature called Protoceratops .  But the Protoceratops fought back. It  has thrown the Velociraptor to the  ground before it, and its jaws are  locked on to the predator’s right arm.  The bite appears to have broken the  Velociraptor ‘s arm.  What happened next?  One possibility is that a sand dune  collapsed on them while they were  still fighting for their lives. CERATOSAURUS It was a carnivorous   dinosaur in the Late  Jurassic period and  discovered in Garden  Park, Colorado. It was estimated to grow  to be 23 feet long and  weighed about 2.2 tons.   It had deep jaws that  supported proportionally  very long, blade -like  teeth, a prominent,  ridge-like horn on the  midline of the snout, and  a pair of horns over the  eyes. BRACHIOSAURUS Brachiosaurus lived in North  America during the Late Jurassic  period, about 154 –153 million  years ago.  The generic name is Greek for  ""arm lizard"", in reference to its  proportionately long arms (front  legs), and the specific name  means ""deep chest"".  They were 59 to 69 feet long  and weighed 31.2 to 64 tons).  APATOSARUS Apatosaurus means   ""deceptive lizard”  and is a herbivorous  dinosaur that lived in  North America during  the Late Jurassic  period.  They had an average  length of 69 –75 ft  and an average  weight of 18.1 –24.7   tons, with some  being even larger  than that.  DIPLODOCUS They lived in mid - western North America at  the end of the Jurassic  period. Diplodocus is one of the  more common dinosaur  fossils when they lived  154 to 152 million years  ago Its great size may have  been a deterrent to the  predators Allosaurus and  Ceratosaurus Mamenchisaurus was also one of the biggest sauropod dinosaurs, known for their  remarkably long necks which made up half the total body length.  It lived from 160 to 145 million years ago of the late Jurassic Period in China .  The largest species may have reached 115 ft in length and possibly weighed 66 -88 tons).The Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic  era may have seen more dinosaurs then  ever before and went from 144- 65Million Years Ago .  The horned Cretaceous dinosaurs  appeared, like the Triceratops and  Centrosaurus .  The armored Ankylosaurus, duckbilled  Parasaurolophus, and large carnivore  Tyrannosaurus Rex were a few of the  quickly evolving dinosaurs.  Birds became increasingly numerous &  flowering plants were emerging.  By the end of the Cretaceous period,     65 –66 million years ago, all large and  small ruling reptiles, except some   crocodiles and birds went extinct.An Oviraptor sitting on the eggs in its nest to     protect them until they hatch.  Most dinosaurs did   this. Oviraptor lived in the late Cretaceous  period,  about 75 million years ago.ARCHAEORNITHOMIMUS Archaeornithomimus (meaning ""ancient bird  mimic"") is a dinosaur that  lived in Asia during the Late  Cretaceous period, around 96  million years ago. It was medium sized,  reaching 11 feet long with a  weight ranging from 99 to  201 pounds  Solid evidence show that it  was a feathered animal. PACHYCEPHALOSAURUS Pachycephalosaurus meaning ""thick -headed  lizard lived during the Late  Cretaceous Period of what  is now North America.  Remains have been  excavated in Montana,  South Dakota, Wyoming,  Alaska, and Alberta. It was the largest of the  bone-headed dinosaurs  and was about 14.8 ft long  and weighed about  990pounds. The image on the next  page shows the 4 types in  the Family. CORYTHOSAURUS It is a hadrosaurid  ""duck -billed"" dinosaur  from the Upper  Cretaceous Period,  about 77 –75.7 million  years ago.  It lived in North  America. Its name means  ""helmet lizard.   It grew  to 30 feet long   and had a skull,  including the crest, that  is 28 inches tall. OLORITAN Olorotitan was a  duckbilled dinosaur  from the Late  Cretaceous, whose  remains were found in  far Eastern Russia.  They grew up to 26 feet  long and weighed 3.4   tons. It was one of the last  non-avian dinosaurs  and it went extinct  during the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction  event. MUTTABURRASA URUS Muttaburrasaurus was  aherbivorous  dinosaur, which lived  in what is now  northeastern Australia  sometime between  105 and 103 million  years ago during the  early Cretaceous  Period.  It was about 26 feet  long  and weighed  around 3.1 tons. MAIASAURA Maiasaura means ""good  mother reptile"" and is a  large herbivorous  ""duck -billed"" dinosaur  that lived in the area  currently covered by  the state of Montana in  the Upper Cretaceous  Period, about 76.7  million years ago. It was about 30 feet  long and weighed up to  4 tons.  EDMONTOSAURUS It is type of duck -billed  dinosaur and has 2  known species found in  western North America,   from the late Cretaceous  Period, 73 million years  ago It was 39 feet long and  weighed up to 4.4 tons. It and the  Parasaurolophus on the next page are  part of the Hadrosaurid  family. PARASAUROLOPHUS It is aherbivorous  dinosaur that  lived in what is now North America  and possibly Asia during the Late  Cretaceous Period, about 76.5 –73  million years ago. It has a large, elaborate cranial  crest, which at its largest forms a  long curved tube projecting  upwards  and back from the skull. The purpose of the crest may be  for visual recognition, a mating  attraction, sound resonance, or  heat regulation. Other members of its family are  shown in the 2 images on the next  slide. SAUROPELTA Sauropelta means 'lizard shield’) and  lived in the Early Cretaceous Period of  North America 108.5 million years  ago.  Fossilized remains were  recovered in  Wyoming, Montana, and Utah.  It measured 17 feet long with a very  long tail which made up about half of  its body length.  It weighed about 3,300 pounds (1.65  tons), with the extra weight largely  due to its extensive covering of bony  armor, including the characteristically  large spines projecting from its neck. NODOSAURUS It lived in the Late  Cretaceous period and  lived in North America. It grew to a length of     20 feet and weighed 3.85   tons.  ANKYLOSAURUS Ankylosaurus an armored dinosaur  that lived at the very end of the  Cretaceous Period, about 68 –66 million  years ago, in western North America. It was one of the last non -avian  dinosaurs when the Cretaceous period  ended.  Possibly the largest -known  ankylosaurid, it is estimated to have  been between 20 and 26 feet long and  weighed between 4.8 and 8  tons).  It was covered in armor plates  and  had a large club on the end of its tail  that could be swung at anything trying  to attack it. Other members of the same Family are  shown on the next slide. When persons were digging in a  coal mine, they found an  exquisitely preserved fossil of an  armored dinosaur ever discovered  –a species of ankylosaur that in  2017 would be named  Borealopelta markmitchelli . After being unearthed, the 110 - million -year-old fossil ended up at  the Royal Tyrrell Museum of  Paleontology in Drumheller, Alberta,  where technicians spent 7,000  hours over the next six years  chiseling away the rock around  it.  Its another example of an  animal that showed what color  it had been and that it had the  property called countershading .COUNTERSHADING As example was found that  Psittacosaurus , an early relative  of the famed horned dinosaur  Triceratops , was light on its  underside and darker on top. This color pattern, known as  countershading, is a common  form of camouflage in modern  animals It was dark smears that caught  the attention of University of  Bristol palaeo -biologist and fossil  color expert, Dr Jakob Vinther .  Analysis of the smears revealed  traces of a reddish pigment,  indicating the dinosaur’s skin  color. Borealopelta had entered the  select group of dinosaurs to have  their true colors revealed. Today, animals use color for  camouflage, communication,  attracting mates and warding off  predators.  Dinosaurs almost certainly did,  too. SINOCERATOPS It is a Ceratopsian  dinosaur that lived  approximately 73 million  years ago during the  latter part of the  Cretaceous Period in what  is now Shandong province  in China.  It was a medium -sized,  herbivore and could grow  up to 19.7 feet long and  6.6 feet high.  It weighed  up to 2.2 tons.  . CHASMOSAURUS Its name means  'opening lizard',  referring to the large  areas in its front frill. It grew to a length of  15.7 feet and weighed  up to 2.2  tons PENTACERATOPS It lived in the late  Cretaceous Period, in   North America. They lived around 76 – 73 million years ago, in  New Mexico. They grew to 20 feet  long and weighed up to  5.5 tons. TRICERATOPS They first appeared during the  late Cretaceous period, about  68 million years ago, in North  America.  They grew to 29.5 feet long  and weighed up to 13.2      tons !! It was one of the last known  dinosaurs and became extinct  in the Cretaceous –Paleogene  extinction event, 66 million  years ago.  The name Triceratops,  means  ""three -horned face“. Other members of this horned  dinosaur family are shown on  the next page.  MAJUNGASAURAUS It lived in Madagascar  from 70 to 66 million  years ago making it one of  the last known non -avian  dinosaurs that went  extinct during the  Cretaceous –Paleogene  extinction event. It was medium -sized at  26.2 feet long and  weighed 3,300 pounds  (1.65 tons). BARYONYX It lived in the early  Cretaceous period, about  130–125 million years ago,  in Surrey, England. Its name means ""heavy  claw"" which refers to the  animal's very large claw on  the first finger. It has a very long snout  with lots of teeth as it  mostly caught and ate fish. Baryonyx is estimated to  have been between 25 and  33 feet long and to have  weighed between 1.3 and  2.1  tons. NIGERSAURAUS It is a dinosaur that lived  during the middle  Cretaceous period, about  115 to 105 million years  ago and discovered in  the Republic of Niger. It was 30 feet long,  which is small for a  sauropod, and had a  short neck.  It weighed around 4  tons, comparable to a  modern elephant.  IGUANODON  They lived in Belgium, Spain,  Germany, England, Portugal  and possibly elsewhere in  Europe, between about 126  and 122 million years ago. They were large, bulky  herbivores.  They weighed up to 3.4 tons  and measured up to 43 feet  long Distinctive features include  large thumb spikes, which  were possibly used for defense  against predators, combined  with long prehensile fifth  fingers able to forage for food. CARNOTAURUS It was a large theropod  dinosaur that lived in  South America during the  Late Cretaceous period,  between 72 and 69.9  million years ago. It was a lightly built,   predator, measuring 24.6  to 29.5 ft long and  weighed up to 3.3  tons).  It had thick horns above  the eyes, a feature unseen  in all other carnivorous  dinosaurs, and a very deep  skull sitting on a muscular  neck. ALBERTOSAURUS It is a tyrannosaurid   dinosaur that lived in  western North America  and an area in Mexico,  during the Late  Cretaceous Period, about  70 million years ago.  It was smaller than  Tyrannosaurus Rex and  measured up to 30 feet  long An adult weighed from 3  to 4.4 tons.    THERIZINOSAURUS  The name means ""scythe  lizard“ and they were a  very large herbivorous  dinosaurs that lived in Asia  during the Late Cretaceous  period, around 70 million  to 68 million years ago.  Even though they ate  plants, they had the  longest hand claws –up to  3.3 feet long, of any land  animal, to protect  themselves. They grew to 33 feet long  and weighed over 5 tons.SUCHOMIMUS Its name means  ""crocodile mimic“  and it is a type of  spinosaurid dinosaur that lived  between 125 and  112 million years  ago in what is now  Niger, in West  Africa. It was 31 to 36 feet  long and weighed  up to 5.7 tons. CARCHARODONT OSAURUS It was a  carnivorous   dinosaur that  existed during the  mid-Cretaceous  Period in Northern  Africa.  It is nearly as  large as or even  larger than  Tyrannosaurus,  Giganotosaurus  and  Spinosaurus.at 33  feet long and  weighing 4.4 tons. ACROCANTHOSAURUS It lived in  North America  during the early Cretaceous  period.  It is best known for the high  neural spines on many of its  vertebrae, which most likely  supported a ridge of muscle  over the animal's neck, back,  and hips. It was one of the largest  dinosaurs, reaching 38 feet in  length and weighing up to 6.8   tons. TYRANOSAURUS  REX It lived in western North  America during the early   Cretaceous period, 68 to  66 million years ago. They grew to be 40 feet  long and adults weighed  15.4 tons. It was the last known  member of the  tyrannosaurids, and  among the last non -avian  dinosaurs to exist before  the Cretaceous –Paleogene  extinction event. GIGANOTOSAURUS It was a dinosaur that  lived in what is now  Argentina, during the  late Cretaceous  period, approximately  98 million years ago. It was 39 to 43 feet  long and the adults  weighed 15.2 tons.  SPINOSAURUS Itlived in what now is  North Africa during  the Cretaceous period,  about 112 to 93.5  million years ago.  Its length ranged from      49–52 feet and it  weighed 7.1 –8.3 tons. It mostly caught and  ate big fish that its  mouth was designed  for. DREADNOUGHTUS It is a sauropod dinosaur  discovered in the early   Cretaceous period -99–94  Million Years ago (MYA),  found in Argentina. It is one of the largest of all  known terrestrial  vertebrates, possessing the  greatest mass of any land  animal that can be  calculated with reasonable  certainty, weighing in about  42 tons and 85 feet long ! THE LARGEST DINOSAUR  OF ALL ! It is estimated to have been 55.1 – 106.3 tons and 98 –130 ft long !!MASS EXTINCTIONS There have been at least 5 major extinctions of Life over the last 540 million years. The  happened at the end of the Ordovician era, Devonian, Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous - Tertiary (or the K-T) Mass Extinction. PERMIAN -TRASSIC  EXTINCTION Just before the beginning of the  Triassic period, at the end of the  Permian period, Earth experienced  its largest mass extinction. It is called the “Great Dying”. 90 percent of all marine life,  and 70 percent of all land  animals were wiped out when  the temperature soared, the  oceans acidified, and there was  large-scale volcanic activity. Even though is was sad that so  many creatures died, it did  contribute to the rise of the  dinosaurs, towards the end of  the Triassic period. There have been 5 major extinction events that eliminated a large percent of the animals  and plants living at each of those times.   One of the main events was when a large asteroiid hit the earth in the Yucatan peninsula,  65 million years ago, which is believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs.THE IRIDIUM METAL LAYER Iridium is one of the rarest metals in the  Earth’s crust. Most scientists today believe that a giant  asteroid crashed into earth in the Gulf of  Mexico, creating a nuclear -winter type of  event that killed most animals and  plants living at that time. This belief is based on the presence of a  thin layer of iridium metal , shocked  quartz and microtektites (small melted  glass balls) found in the sedimentary  layer dating to 65 million years ago and  found in about 100 places, all around  the world. Iridium is found in meteorites in much  higher abundance than in the Earth's  crust.  For this reason, the unusually high  abundance of iridium in the clay layer  at the Cretaceous –Paleogene  boundary gave rise to the Alvarez  hypothesis that the impact of a  massive extraterrestrial object caused  the extinction of dinosaurs and many  other species 66 million years ago. This layer is termed the K -T layer  (Cretaceous -Tertiary layer). The  initial “K” is used because the  abbreviation for the German term  for Cretaceous is Kreide which  also means chalk as there was a  thick layer of it laid down before  that.

Below is an animation of the impact.DINOSAURS THAT  EVOLVED  INTO BIRDS It began in the 1960s  with the revolutionary  discovery of  Deinonychus , another  small predatory dinosaur  that lived about 115  million years ago, that  had light feathers on it. It not only showed  unique similarities to  birds, but also appeared  to be an intelligent, fast - moving pack hunter,  rather than a slow,  plodding reptile. WHAT IS THE SMALLEST  DINOSAUR?  Anchiornis huxleyi was a tiny,  long-legged, winged dinosaur.  Covered in feathers, it is seen by  many as an evolutionary link  between dinosaurs and birds. It  lived in what is now China, in  the late Jurassic period, around  167.7 million years ago. With long feathers found on both  fore and hind limbs, it may have  been a better glider than it was a  flyer –if it left the ground at all! One of the smallest dinosaurs yet  discovered, it weighed between 3.9  and 24.7 oz. and was between 13  and 16 inches, in length. HOW SOME DINOSAURS  BECAME BIRDS  Some dinosaurs grew very large. As others realized that safety and   food could be found in the air and  trees, they morphed into birds,   shrank dramatically and adopted a  more baby -like skull shape and also  had feathers.

At the right is a  fossil of the  'earliest bird’ which  was the first time  that feathers could  be seen on a  prehistoric bird.ARCHAEOPTERYXVELOCIRAPTOR eagle.FINDING COLOR IN  FEATHERS AND SKIN OF  DINOSAURS Microraptor , the four -winged  dinosaur from China, has  melanosomes that suggest not  only a blue -black coloration,  but also a beautiful sheen,  similar to a Eurasian magpie or  a crow. So far, 7 dinosaurs have had  their colors revealed through  their fossils.Microraptor gui Lived in Northeastern China,  In the early -Cretaceous Period, 120 million years  ago)CAIHONG JUJIBirds and  crocodilians (in  this case a  yellow -billed  stork and a Nile  crocodile) are the  only living  archosaur  groups.Over time, very different living  things have appeared, one after  the other.  For example, the development  of a spinal column allowed  certain animals, such as fish,   to swim more efficiently, more  than 400 million years ago.  Little by little, an animal  that was a mixture of a  crocodile and a fish,  developed lungs and feet  and conquered dry land.

Thank you Please make a donation on Patreon to support Monkey Pens Free Book Project:Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Ginger.  Ginger lived in Kenya, a country in Africa. Like all  giraffes, Ginger had a long neck and long legs. Because  she was so tall, she was able to eat food from the very  tops of the trees in the savannah.  The savannah in  Africa is an area with lots of grass and some trees.  Sometimes, a savannah is called grasslands. The other  animals like zebras and antelopes could not reach where  Ginger could reach.  But Ginger always found food.  She  loved the leaves and the new buds of the trees. One day, Ginger was busy eating her favorite leaves along  with some other giraffes.  It was a bright sunny day and  there was not a cloud in the sky.  It had not rained for a long  time, so the grass was very dry.  She heard a noise down at  the bottom of her extra long legs: it was her friend, Mickey  the Monkey.  Mickey was trying to say something, but Ginger  couldn’t understand what he was saying.  He looked very  tired.  “What’s wrong?” asked Ginger.  Ginger was a very kind  giraffe and wanted to help everyone.   Just then Mickey fell over!Ginger was also a smart giraffe.  She knew what was wrong.   Mickey couldn’t find anything to eat and he was very hungry.   Ginger nibbled some fresh, tender leaves and buds from the  top of the tree where she was eating.  She dropped some of  the leaves and buds to the ground near where Mickey was.   Then she nudged him a little with the hoof at the bottom of  one of her very long legs.  “Wake up, Mickey!” said Ginger.   “I’ve found something for you to eat.”   Slowly Mickey sat up and ate a little.  After a while, when Mickey was feeling better, Ginger asked  him, “What’s happened, Mickey?  Why are you so hungry?   Why can’t you find anything to eat?”  Mickey said, “It hasn’t  rained for so long and now there’s no more food.”  “That’s  not good,” said Ginger.  “What’s happening with the other  animals?”  “No one knows what to do,” answered Mickey.  “All  the zebras and the antelopes and the elephants are getting  worried about the dry grass.   Some of them are thinking about leaving the savannah and  trying to reach the jungle.”   “That’s a long trip,” said Ginger.   “Are you going to go with them?”“I don’t know,” answered Mickey.  “What do you think we  should do?”  Ginger thought for a while and then suddenly, she  had a good idea. “We should go talk to Leo the Lion.   He is the smartest animal in the savannah!”  Mickey was too  tired to walk, so Ginger invited him to ride on her back.  “Hold  on tight to my neck,” said Ginger.  “There’s a lot to hold on  to,” joked Mickey.  Ginger laughed.  “You’re right.  I’ve got the  longest neck in Africa!”  So they started their journey across  to the other side of the savannah to look for Leo.Ginger and Mickey were in luck!  Leo was sitting up on a rock  and he was really easy to see as they walked through the  grass.  “Hi, Leo!” they both shouted.  Leo had been napping  and was a little grumpy when they woke him up.  But he was  polite and said, “Hello Ginger and Mickey.  Why did you walk  the whole way across the savannah?  Just to wake me up?”   But he was joking; he had a smile on his face.  “Mickey says  that there is no food left on the savannah because it’s been  so dry,” said Ginger.  “Do you have any ideas?”Leo thought for a while.  He said, “There’s nothing we can do  about the rain.  It will come soon, but we can’t be sure when it  will arrive.  When the rain comes, all the plants will grow again  and there will be lots of food for everybody.”   He thought a little longer.  “The only thing I can think of is  for everyone to move closer to the forest,” he continued.   “There will be more things to eat there, but I know it’s a long  trip and it will not be very easy.  It might take days to get there.”Ginger and Mickey looked at each other and then looked back  at Leo.  “Thank you, Leo,” said Ginger.  “It’s probably best if  they all try to get closer to the jungle.”  They said goodbye  and then walked back across the savannah.   Now they needed to gather all of the animals together to  start the long journey.  Ginger didn’t need to go along because  she had plenty of food in her high trees.  But she was a good  friend and wanted to help as much as she could.   They walked towards her favorite trees and guess what she  and Mickey saw?All of the animals were already gathered there and waiting  for Ginger and Mickey!  “Why are you all here?” asked Ginger.   “Eddie the Eagle told us that you’re taking us to the edge of  the jungle,” said one of the zebras.  “How did he know?” asked  Mickey.  “He heard you talking with Leo,” said one of the  antelopes.  “So you’ve all decided to try to walk together to  the jungle?” asked Ginger.  “Yes,” they all answered.  “If you’ll  help us to get there,” added one of the elephants.   “Of course, I’ll help,” said Ginger.  “I’m your friend.”So  they started on their big journey across the savannah  to the jungle.  The sun was so hot and there was no food and  no place to get a drink of water.  And then they heard it.  It  was thunder!  “Thunder!” they all shouted.  Thunder was very  scary to the animals of the savannah.  Can you guess why?   Fire!  Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the  whole savannah catches fire.  Then everyone has to run.  And  that is exactly what happened.  “Fire!” they shouted.  They  could smell it.  And now they could see it.   The fire was coming towards them!Ginger had to think fast.  Because she was so tall she could  see farther than any of the other animals.   She stretched her long neck up as far  as she could.  Now she could see a place where there was no  fire.  “Quick!” she said.  “Everyone run this way.”   All of the animals followed her  and ran as fast as they could.  Soon, they were  out of danger.  They stopped and gathered together one  more time.  “Is everyone here?” Ginger asked.  She wanted  to make sure they were all safe.   All the animals looked around; they were all there.  And then the most wonderful thing happened.  “I felt a  drop,” said a zebra.  “Me too,” said an antelope.  It was rain!   Finally!  Everyone was very happy.  It started to rain a little  more and then a little more.  The rain put out the fire so  they didn’t have to run.  And the rain filled their watering  holes and made the plants grow again,  so they didn’t have to make that long trip to the edge of the  jungle.  Everyone would soon have enough food and water.   So Ginger, the Giraffe went back to her favorite tree and  continued to munch on the leaves and buds.Please share our books  with your friends and  family to support our mission .

2210-billy_boy-terry.greenwell-FKB.txt,"  Dedicated to the loving memory of   BILLYBOY   1999 – 2017   He was a very    “Good Boy”                                                                                          Billy Boy   The Sheep Dog Years       “To do your very best   is the best you can b e…..  And, anyway sheep dog stuff was never my thing!”   Billy Boy                 Written and illustrated by Terry Greenwell                                       Down on the Farm  Billy Boy was one of three pups born on a sheep farm  somewhere in England. It was a farm much like any other .  Early mornings, hard graft , and always  busy day in day out  caring for the livestock.   Billy was not always known by that name;  in fact,  his birth   name was “Rocky”. However, in respect for Billy’s gentle  nature and the fact that he chose his new name for  himself we shall refer to him as B illy Boy or Billy from now  on.   There wasn’t much that was very rock -like about Billy  anyway. You  see, he was more of a lovely soft  fruit jelly  kind of dog  - you know, the kind of jelly that melts in your  mouth and explodes  with glorious flavours . Billy melted   hearts  and filled rooms with  laughter  wherever he went,  anywhere , anytime.   His two brothers were named Thor and Loki, and like their  lofty namesakes , they would grow to embod y the  elemental qualities of fire and ice.   Early on before the brothe rs began to grow, they all  looked  very  much  alike, little bundles of joyous fur, wet  noses , and puppy dog eyes. Mum was a Springer Spaniel  and dad was an Irish Collie. Quite the ideal mix for Sheep  Dog splendour. Well, two out of three times , it seems , in  this particular case.  Thor and Loki grew and grew and  then  grew  some more .  They were both broad, lean, muscular , chisel  jawed , and  dashing.  Each had a penetrating gaze, a quality much  needed and admired amongst Sheep Dog folk, as it was  the key to brilliant  herding.        Billy grew too, but not so much . He cut a more delicate  figure, some less kind might even say  “scrawny”. Billy  himself considered his less threatening presence a plus  point. After all the pigs, geese, ducks , and even the rats on  the farm adored him and clamoured for his company and  kind hearted convivial conversation. Unfortunately, the  sheep who made up th e greater part of the farm’s   population  chose to  ignor e him. That is something to be   very  concerned about for any budding Sheep Dog.  You see, Sheep Dog s have a unique ability (to do with that  penetrating gaze mentioned earlier ) that is known in the  trade as “THE EYE” .  A good Sheep Dog can freeze any other animal to the spot  just by locking eyes with it. This stare is almost magical, it  is as if invisible daggers of ice are shooting through the air.  Whole herds of sheep can be made to stop, move this  way, m ove that way, reverse, go forward , or even  spin on  the spot if the dog desires  it so . Imagine that, your  remote -control toy car doing what you want it to using  just your eyes!   Billy should  have had THE EYE  like his brothers  but it was  buried too deep within  him and despite  his very best  efforts  he was unable to bring it to the surface. Anyway, it  has to be said, he found sheep a trifle dull  and a tad  stupid .     The pigs on the other hand knew everything that was  going  on. The ducks had the best gossip , the ducks could  quack on forever , and the rats were  just plain funny.   Billy did try to be a good Sheep Dog but it just never  worked out.  Billy decided to stop trying anymore and to  enjoy his time on the farm as much as he could in the  company of his many friends,  of which there were many.         And so, Billy framed his life in a way that suited him whilst  he figured out a way to find his Happy Place .  Quite honestly, his brothers were pleased that Billy had  stepped back from his Sheep Dog duties and the shee p  barely noticed he was gone. He was after al l a liability out  on the pastures and things ran so much better in his  absence.   Life wasn’t so bad during those fallow times. Late  mornings, a good old chin wag by the duck pond and time  to work things out at hi s leisure.   Then Billy had his LIGHT BULB moment.   One sunny day h e was sitting in the back of the farmers  Land Rover  parked up at the roadside , supposedly  guarding the chicken feed whilst his master popped into  his local village pub for a quick pint of ale.  Sitting on a nearby bench  were two teenagers, a boy and  a girl entertaining their pet dog with treats for tricks.   At that moment as he watched the pair playing with their  adoring dog whose  wagging tail looked like it might just  wag itself right off, B illy knew  for certain  that draughty  barns, early mornings and pursuing ignorant sheep were  soon to be behind him.  He too would be a “PET” with a  snuggly bed, a comfy spot on the sofa and light day time   duties entertaining the kids . “That’s the life for me,”  he thought.  Now to plan his  daring escape.             Lots of things arrive at farms, lots of things leave farms,  but dogs generally stay. Lorries, trucks and a variety of  vehicle s come  and go on a daily basis. It was all about  choosing his moment and the r ight person to make it  happen.  There was one particular Driver who always  made a fuss of Billy, his name was Zane and he travelled  up and down the country and seemed to know just about  everyone.   Billy waited for Zane to arrive, let him do his stuff , then  just as he was about to get into his truck Billy made his  move.   A few neat tricks, some appropriate noises and head rubs  later , Zane figured out Billy’s intention and invited Billy  into the cab.                  “Keep your head down boy, let’s make our escape .”  The truck pulled out of the farm yard and was soon far , far  away.   Billy settled down for the trip and popped his hairy head  out of the cab window. The wind tussled his fur and blew  away his worries a nd concerns.  His future awaited him.   “I know just the place for you Billy Boy!” exclaimed Zane.                                 The truck came to a halt, Billy stirred from his contented  sleep as Zane jumped from the cab.   “We’re here Billy Boy, there’s someone I want you to  meet,” said Zane.   Billy jumped down and stood at Zane’s side.   “That over there is the legendary Mrs. Barker, I think you  two are going to get along just fine.” Zane  was pointing  towards a plump woman in workaday clothes; she was  waving and smiling a s she leant on her garden fence. All  around her were dogs of all sizes and shapes. The dogs  were sporting grins too , just like Mrs.  Barker.   Zane led Billy to the garden gate, gave him a firm hug and  made his way back to his truck and took off. Billy watche d  it disappearing over a hill  and then it was gone.   Mrs. Barker opened the gate and welcomed Billy to his  new home , for now.   It was just a small step but Billy knew it was a n even   bigger step towards a brighter future.            Next instalment  to come !   Billy finds his forever home     ","The story is about Billy Boy, a sheepdog born on a farm in England. Billy was one of three pups born on the farm and had two brothers named Thor and Loki. While his brothers grew to be broad, lean, muscular, and ideal Sheep Dogs, Billy grew into a more delicate figure, making him less threatening. Billy was unable to develop the unique ability known as THE EYE, which good Sheep Dogs possess, and could freeze any other animal in place just by locking eyes with it. Despite his best efforts, he was unable to bring this ability to the surface. Billy decided to stop trying to be a Sheep Dog and enjoy his time on the farm with his many friends.

FKB-kids-stories-tanias-slumber.txt,"Tania's Slumber Party It was 2 nd  March 2016. So you know what the occasion was, don't you? Yes, you got it right. It was Tania's 6 th  birthday. Can you believe she is already 6 years old? My goodness! How time flies, when you are having fun with Tania. Tania's 6 th  birthday celebrations turned out to be a lot more dramatic and exciting than mama had planned. This is how it all began. A week before Tania's birthday, mama asked ""Tania, how would you like to celebrate your birthday this year? We could have a party at home, or we could take your friends on a picnic. What do you think?"" Tania hesitated. She said, ""Mama you just had our room renovated and it is lovely. I was wondering if I could have a few of my friends over for a slumber party. Miss Gupta said school is closed on 2 nd  March, because the teachers have to go for a training seminar. So it works out perfectly. My friends can come over on the evening of thest  and leave on the 2 nd  after breakfast. Is that okay mama? Please, pretty please."" Mama said ""Of course baby. That is a great idea! I'll help you plan out some slumber party activities. Decide who you want to invite. We can't fit more than 4 or 5 kids. Sonia can sleep in my room that night."" The next afternoon Tania told mama that she only wanted her closest friends Tanisha, Karishma and Sonali at the party. She thought it would be more fun if it was an all girl affair. But it would be nice to invite Nikhil, Vivek and Rajiv (the remaining members of Tania's reading club ' The Bookworm Babies ') for the birthday breakfast. Mama agreed and Tania and mama made a wonderful slumber party invitation card for her 3 favourite girlfriends.As the week went on mama planned the activities and bought supplies, while Tania and her friends waited impatiently for their first ever slumber party. Finally it was the evening of 1 st  March. Karishma, Sonali and Tanisha arrived together at Tania's house at sharp 7:00 p.m. They were all dressed in pyjamas as requested in the invitation. Tania too was wearing the new set of pyjamas, mama had got her for the occasion.Tania ushered her friends in to her room. The renovations had just got done the previous week, so her friends had not seen her newly done room yet. They were eager to see how Tania and mama had set it up. The girls were very impressed with the tastefully furnished and  decorated room, but then Tanisha spotted only 2 sleeping spaces and asked, ""Tania there are 4 of us and 2 spots to sleep. How is that going to work?"" Sonali and Karishma looked questioningly at Tania too. Tania replied, ""Mama has planned some activities for us so we will need the floor space now. But later papa will move in two beds from the guest room. Don't worry. Mama has it all figured out.""""What activities?"" asked Sonali curiously as mama walked in to the room. Karishma had just picked up a pink box lying on the floor. Mama pointed to the box that Karishma was holding and said ""You will be needing that for your first activity."" Karishma opened the box. It had a stack of 4 freshly laundered, crisply ironed bedsheets. ""What are we supposed to do with these?"" asked Sonali bewildered. Mama said ""I have got some fabric paints. So you can decorate your sheets by painting whatever picture you like on them."" ""Oh! that explains why the beds don't have sheets on them. We get to decorate our sheets and then make our beds with the sheet we decorated. That is brilliant. When can we start? "" asked Tanisha.""How about right now?"" said mama. Tania and mama went to a cupboard in Tania's room and took out the fabric paints, paint brushes, pencils and erasers. Tania, being a gracious host, let the others choose their sheets first. Tanisha picked the green one, Sonali the blue one and Karishma picked the brown one, leaving Tania the grey one. Mama spread out a lot of newspaper on the floor for the girls to sit on and paint. The girls spent a glorious hour painting their sheets and chatting. They came up with excellent ideas that really suited the colour of the sheet. Sonali used the blue background of her sheet as the sky and painted on a rainbow and clouds. She said ""The clouds make me think of pillows and a rainbow is lovely to wake up to.""Karishma, who loved stuffed animals, and had brought her teddy bear to sleep with, painted a picture of the teddy on her brown sheet. Tanisha, the most artistically talented of the lot, used the green background of her sheet to represent a meadow and drew sheepon either side of a fence. She said ""I like to count sheep when I can't sleep. I picture them jumping over a fence one at a time as I count them."" Tania had the grey sheet, which seemed a little gloomy to her, but then she remembered the gorgeous night sky she had seen on the night there was a blackout and decided to paint it. That would definitely liven up a grey sheet.Around 8:00 p.m., when the girls were done painting their sheets, mama announced dinner. The girls carefully left their sheets to dry and joined mama, papa and Sonia at the dining table. The delicious aromas wafting through the air, were making their mouths water.The girls gorged on a fabulous meal consisting of biriyani, palak paneer, green beans and parathas. There was fresh strawberries and ice-cream for desert. Finally, when everyone except Sonia had finished eating, Sonali noticed a large gift wrapped item on the coffee table. She asked ""What is that?"" Mama said ""Tania, that is the gift papa and I got you for your birthday. Why don't you open it?"" ""Now? I can open it now? Don't I have to wait till tomorrow?"" ""I think it is a good idea for you to open this particular gift now."" said mama. Excited and very curious, Tania opened the package. Inside was a beautiful doll house. Her friends helped her arrange the furniture that was included in the set. It was a quaint 2 storey house with a bedroom, a bathroom, a living room and a kitchen. It also had a garage, a terrace and a yard with a pool.Mama said, ""I have bookmarked some youtube videos about making doll furniture and got you some craft supplies. You girls can trymaking some doll furniture if you like."" Tania was thrilled. She hugged mama and papa and thanked them both. Then she added, ""Mama, you are the coolest mother ever."" The girls spent the next hour working on doll house furniture. But it was a lot harder than they expected. They did well with making curtains, bed covers and pillows but chairs, sofas, tables and swings were a lot harder than youtube made it look. Still, the girls had a great time. At 10:00 mama came by and said it was bed time. So, the girls cleared up, and papa brought in the two extra beds from the guest room. The painted sheets were dry and ready for use. So the girls, with some help from mama, made up the beds. Mama handed out a couple of fluffy white pillows to each girl.  She told them they could each pick out a book if they wanted to read in bed or they couldjust chat or play a board game, but either way she would come at 11:00 to switch off the lights. The girls were thrilled to have a whole extra hour to stay up past their usual bed time. No one really felt like reading so, they chatted and played the card game Uno. Soon they started feeling really sleepy and when mama came in at 11:00 all the girls were fast asleep. Mama quietly switched off the lights and left. Another hour went by. Everything was quiet. Even Kazoo was snoozing. Suddenly a chilling, blood curdling scream pierced the silence. Mama woke up with a start. The girls were sleeping soundly and had not heard the first scream. But the screams continued and the girls woke up too. ""What is going on?"" asked Tania ""Do you think someone is being murdered?"" asked Tanisha sounding horrified. The girls came out of their room. Mama was just about to open the main door, whenKarishma said ""Don't do that. The burglar may have a gun."" ""What burglar? What gun?"" asked mama puzzled. ""There is a woman shrieking. May be someone has pulled a gun on her."" said Karishma, her teeth chattering in fright. Just then the screaming stopped. Mama said ""Calm down Karishma. I am going to open the door to find out what is going on. Sounds like Mrs. Sharma next door is in some kind of distress. I am going to see if she needs help."" Mama was just about to call out to Mrs. Sharma when Mr. Sharma opened the door. Mama asked what had happened. Mr . Sharma sounded most embarrassed as he explained, ""We forgot to close the netting on the bedroom window and a cat got in. Mrs. Sharma woke up to see 2 shinning green eyes staring at her in the dark.""""When her initial fright of seeing something paranormal subsided, she realized it was a cat. Unfortunately my wife is ailurophobic. I am so sorry you all got woken up."" continued Mr. Sharma apologetically. ""Allure a what? "" asked Sonali amazed that all this drama seemed to be about a cat. ""Ailurophobia is an irrational fear of cats"" explained mama and then turned to Mr. Sharma. ""I see. Is the cat out now?"" ""No my wife is hiding in the bathroom. Her screams frightened the cat and it is hiding under the bed. I will now try to coax it out so we can go back to bed. Tania said, ""I love cats. I can help you getthe kitty out."" Mr. Sharma gladly accepted her help. Tania had expected to see a sinister, evil looking cat. But the kitty under the bed just looked terrified. The bed in Mr. Sharma's house was relatively high and Tania was small enough to easily crawl under it. But she approached the kitty very slowly. She did not want to frighten it any further. She made soothing soft sounds as she approached. Then, slowly, she pet the kitty. The kitty began to trust her. Tania had an amazing way with animals. A few minutes later, Tania slowly picked up the kitty and took it out and put it in thestairwell so it could find its way out. Mr. Sharma thanked Tania profusely for her help and apologized again for inconveniencing them all. Mrs. Sharma was still in the bathroom. After this little midnight incident everyone was wide awake. Even papa and Sonia had woken up in all the commotion. No body felt sleepy. Mama looked at the clock and said ""Hey look it is 12:30. Tania it is officially your birthday. Happy birthday baby!"" Everyone else wished Tania too. Papa said ""Since we are all here and awake why don't we cut the birthday cake?"" Tania looked pleadingly at mama and said ""Please mama, please. It will make this birthday so exciting."" Mama smiled and said ""Lets do it!"". Mama brought out the cake and lit 7 candles around it. Tania was only 6 years old, but there had to be one for good luck.Tania blew out the candles while everyone sang ""Happy birthday"". Then Tania cut out a slice of cake and fed it to mama, papa and baby Sonia. Mama then gave everyone a large slice of cake and a glass of warm milk. The warm milk made everyone sleepy, and they all went back to bed. What an awesome and thrilling start to a birthday. The next morning everyone including mama slept soundly till 8:00 a.m. Mama was the first to wake up. When she saw the time she hurried through her bath and then went and woke up the girls. The boys from 'The Bookworm Babies' reading club were due to arrive at 9:30 to celebrate Tania's birthdayat breakfast. The girls discussed the exciting and funny night's events as they got ready. At 9:30 the doorbell rang and mama opened the door to 3 boys bearing a large pile of gifts. Tanisha, Karishma and Sonali had asked Rajiv, Nikhil and Vivek to bring their birthday gifts for Tania with them too, so they could all give their presents to Tania at breakfast. Tania thanked all her friends for the presents and put them aside to open later. She then helped mama set up the table for breakfast. Soon the table was laden with chocolate chip and blueberry pancakes, fresh cut fruits, oatmeal porridge, toasts, jam, butter, honey and syrup. There was tea formama and papa and strawberry milkshake for everyone else. Mama had stacked up about half a dozen pancakes and used chocolate sauce to write 'Happy Birthday Tania' on them. She put 7 candles around the pancake stack. Tania blew out the candles again while everyone sang 'Happy Birthday'. The girls were impressed with how mama had improvised given that the cake had already been cut in the middle of the night.Tania, her friends and family had a fun and scrumptious birthday breakfast. The girls told the boys about the midnight happenings. It was a thrilling tale and the boys were jealous they missed out on the excitement. They were especially sad they did not get to see the effects of Karishma's wild imagination on her expression. That evening Mrs. Sharma came by with an awesome surprise for Tania. She had brought a wicker chair and table set and a sofa for Tania's doll house.  Mrs. Sharma happened to be a collector and connoisseur of doll house furniture. She even made doll furniture herself. The chair and table set was from her collection and the sofa, she had made herself.At some point mama had told Mrs. Sharma, that she was getting Tania a doll house for her birthday. Mrs. Sharma was really grateful for Tania's help with getting the cat out. She wanted to give her something special. Since she knew mama had got Tania a doll house, she thought doll furniture was the perfect gift. She even offered to teach Tania how to make some dolls furniture. What a wonderful birthday Tania has had. I hear Mrs. Sharma has invited Tania over this weekend so they can make dolls furniture together. How exciting! I wonder what they will make.","Tania celebrated her 6th birthday with a slumber party on March 2, 2016. Tania asked her mother if she could have a slumber party with her closest friends, and her mother agreed to help plan the party. Tania invited her three closest girlfriends and planned to invite three more boys from her reading club for breakfast on her birthday. Tania's room had just been renovated, so the girls were excited to see it. Tania's mother had planned activities for the girls, and the first activity involved painting and decorating their bed sheets with fabric paint. The girls had a great time painting and chatting, and they all came up with creative ideas for their sheets.

Dr-Freckles-Frog-FKB-Stories.txt,"                        Gingers Wood.                             Dr Freckles Frog.  Dr Freckles sat quietly and nervously one sweet summer   morning in amongst the long grass, he checked his old   tiny pocket watch once, then once again shortly after.      “1 o'clock, I must be there at 1 o'clock”.  Seeing it was only 11:30, he relaxed slightly when he   realised he had time to gobble down his tasty dinner of   wriggle worm pie, then he would have to hop off to be   part of the biggest day of his life … his wedding day.  He had spent no less than one whole week drying out his   wet slippery skin so his suit would fit perfectly and would  not become drenched, at last he was dressed and      ready.                “Oh, it doesn't matter if I'm early.” He said cheerfully before getting up and making his way   around the outskirts of the lake towards the waterfall   church,  suddenly …   He let out a cry as a little reed warbler flew   quickly out from behind the tall reeds causing him to   jump back with shock, then … SPLASH ! He tumbled down the steep little bank and landed  back first into the merky water, First he felt silly, …  then he felt angry, and he soon began to yell and cry  out …          “Oh RERP IT ! … Rerp it, Rerp it all !” He said slapping the shallow water with his small  clenched fists.          “Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for your              wedding and not splashing about in the lake using              that language ?” Dr Freckles looked up onto the bank and saw Hector  Hedgehog staring down at him. He then lifted him out of  the water.           “I was ready and now my suit is ruined, I'll never             make it now !”           “Come on we'll go to mine, I have a warm fire, we'll              get those cloths dry in no time.” Once in Hector's home he made himself  comfortable in a arm chair after he had wrapped  himself in a spider's silk towel, and Hector  Hedgehog put his clothes carefully on the  fire grate to dry.              “MY HAT !”  Dr Freckles suddenly shouted, frightening poor  Hector.           “I've left my hat behind, I can't get married without it, it's             been in my families weddings for generations, it is             our tradition to play a pipe and dance around it after             the wedding, … how do I get it back ?” Just then a knock came at the door and hector  left the room to answer it, it was Ruby Red  Squirrel, Hector told her about Dr Freckles  and as always she was more than happy to help. She headed straight away down to the lake and soon enough she spotted it on the head of a great  crested grebe, he was clearly quite fond of his new hat and Ruby knew right away that it would be  difficult to get him to part with it. Knowing that grebes are not the smartest of creatures she decided   to make up a story to scare him off the hat,  she approached him on the bank.              “Good day sir !”              “Oh hello miss.” He said slapping his long beak as he spoke.             “Oh I see you have the dreaded cursed hat sir”               “The what did you say ?”  He asked becoming quite concerned.             “The cursed hat.”              “Good Lord, cursed you say ? … how ?”             “It is said that whoever wears that hat for more              than a day becomes terribly allergic to water.” The grebe quickly tilted his head forward and the hat fell  to the ground in front of them.             “Allergic to water ! Oh good Lord, well I never.”              “Shall I get rid of it for you sir ?”             “Yes please do dear, what a most dreadful thing.”              “Good day then sir !”  Ruby picked up the hat and headed quickly back, Dr  Freckles then had his hat, and was so very grateful, his  cloths had dried nicely so the wedding went on as planned  behind the small waterfall. Dr Freckles loved Lily Lou in her beautiful  water lily dress and spider silk veil.   After the celebrations he performed his  ancestor's dance around the family hat. The following summer they had new additions to  their family Terry, Thomas and Toby, three baby  tadpoles.

Tanias-School-Picnic-FKB-Stories.txt,"Tania's School Picnic The children in Tania's class at school were chattering excitedly. The soft spoken and mild tempered Miss Gupta had to bang her desk rather violently to get their attention. She said, ""I am glad you are all so excited about the picnic at Kanheri caves. However, the picnic is next week and you can discuss it after class. Right now we need to get back to work.""Work was quite interesting and soon everyone was engrossed in it. The class was supposed to design a cover for a book. The book had been read to them in the previous story time session. The children discussed various ideas withMiss Gupta and came up with 3 that really captured the essence of the story. Miss Gupta then divided the class in to 3 groups of 5 each and had them work together to make the covers. After class Tania, Sonali and Tanisha discussed the picnic. The previous year, they were taken to the lovely park where Tania had learned to ride a bike. Thatwas a lot of fun, but caves just sounded so much more exciting! Tania was getting impatient. The week dragged by really slowly as it always does when you are waiting. Finally the day of the picnic arrived. All 15 children had gathered together in the school courtyard. Miss Gupta carefully checked off their names on a list as they got in to the school bus. By 9:00 a.m. everyone was in the bus.Miss John the art teacher and Miss Gupta were accompanying the children. The bus ride was 45 minutes long because of traffic but the kids had a great time singing 'The wheels of the bus', ' Do Re Me' and many other cheerful songs. Finally the bus arrived at Kanheri caves. The teachers guided the children through the caves. Miss Gupta talkedabout its wonderful history. ""These caves were used by Buddhists for living, studying and meditating almost 2000 years ago. This was an important Buddhist settlement at that time."" said Miss Gupta. Miss John commented on the sculptures of Buddha and the beautiful paintings in some caves.All that walking made everyone hungry and they decided to have an early lunch. The children gathered in the main cave near the entrance.The kids all shared their lunches and had quite a feast. There were chicken, vegetable, egg and jam sandwiches, idlis, uttapams, aloo parathas, fried rice and noodles. For dessert there were cookies, cakes, pastries and gulab jamuns.After lunch the teachers told the children that they could explore the caves on their own and play some games. ""Stick to the 3 caves near the main entrance. Otherwise, there are some hundred odd caves here and you will get lost"" said Miss John.Tania and Tanisha exchanged delighted glances. Ever since they got there the girls thought the caves were an ideal place to play hide and seek. They announced their intention and 6 of the others joined them. Tania went to hide in a little nook she spotted. She was in a great hurry and she tripped over a stone. To steady herself she used the support of the wall. To her great surprise the wall seemed to shake a little. How was that possible? She hit against the same spot again. Yes it definitely did shake just a little bit. Then she banged the wall alittle further away and it did not shake at all. It was rock solid. By this time Tanisha arrived. It was her turn to search for everyone. She looked at Tania in surprise and asked ""Why aren't you hiding? I could see you as soon as I opened my eyes."" Tania told Tanisha what she had found out about the wall. Tanisha tested it too and was amazed. The two girls closely examined the wall. Finally they saw a faint rectangular outline that separated the shaky part from the rest of the wall. They ran their fingers carefully over this part and found two handles of sorts. The handles were well camouflaged jutting out bits of the rock. They each grabbed one and pulled on it. It was hard work but together, sweating and panting, they managed to take off the rectangular piece, revealing a passage.They turned around and noticed the rest of the kids they were playing with were watching them. Tired of hiding and not being found they had come to see what was going on. What they saw made their jaws drop. One of them, Rajiv, went and called the others. Everyone now wanted to explore this exciting secret passage. However the passage was tiny so they had to crawl in one at a time. Tania was the first to enter and she emerged in to a fairly spacious room. There were some copper plates with inscriptions on the walls and some carvings and cave paintings. There was also a stone hearth with someutensils on it. There was no other obvious entry or exit from the room. After every one was in and looked around Tania asked, ""Miss Gupta, do you suppose this is a new discovery?"" Miss Gupta hesitated, so Miss John said, ""Tania this place has been thoroughly explored by professionals so I doubt it. But it is possible they missed this. I will contact the proper authorities and let them know that you found it. If it is indeed a new discovery you willsurely get credit for it. But I think irrespective of that outcome this picnic has been much more exciting than we had anticipated thanks to Tania. Everyone, three cheers to Tania"" Everyone shouted ""Hip hip hooray!""","Tania and her classmates were excited about their upcoming school picnic to Kanheri caves. Before the picnic, the class worked on designing book covers in groups. On the day of the picnic, they traveled by bus with their teachers and had a great time exploring the caves, learning about its history, and having lunch together. Tania and Tanisha discovered a secret passage in the cave while playing hide and seek, and their classmates joined them to explore it. They found a room with ancient inscriptions, carvings, and paintings. Miss John said she would inform the authorities about the discovery, and the class cheered for Tania.","['tania', 'picnic', 'caves', 'tanisha', 'cave']"

Me, I only have the questions! Esoteric Eric was really very cool For he had mastered the Art Of doing nothing at all. He dwelled within a single room, With bed and chair and mat, All he did was eat and sleep, But mostly he just sat Cross legged on his carpet, His eyes gently closed. But never for a moment Did Eric ever doze. For all his journeys were inward Betwixt his pointy ears. In fact, he had never left his room For years and years and years! ESOTERIC ERIC   ESOTERIC ERIC  He seldom took in visitors And rarely spoke a word. So, as I passed in through his door, I am told I was the third.  What was my cause? I hear you ask, That I should chance his way, To visit him, to sit and talk With my respects to pay.  Well, I had heard in whispers spoke Passed down from here to there That Eric had deep knowledge That he might care to share. That knowing what Eric knew Might cast aside all fears. But also whispered quieter still Was the cost, it seemed, was dear. ESOTERIC ERIC    ESOTERIC ERIC   The reason that so very few Had trod his lonely way. Though none had ever spoken Of the currency of pay.  ESOTERIC ERIC  What of them, where were they now? Were their lives healed in every way, And was the cost unspoken,  Worth the cost to pay?  I did not have the answers, To this and questions more, As I opened up and stepped  Through Eric’s lonely door.  “I see I have a visitor,  Do come and take a seat. Take off your coat, remove your shoes And let me rub your feet!”  I must exclaim I was surprised At Eric’s form of greeting! But then recalled, This was no ordinary meeting. ESOTERIC ERIC    So, I sat as Eric worked My feet from heels to toes. Squeezing here and rubbing there. Quite pleasant as it goes.   ESOTERIC ERIC   “So, what of you, why are you here? It’s rare I entertain.”  So, I replied, “I am told you take away all pain, That woes, strife and  Anger dark are never felt again…...”  He stopped me there, with kindly gaze, As hands continued kneading. “Observe the creature out in the field Then ponder as he feeds,”  “He takes his fill, sustains himself, There’s wisdom there to heed. He then moves on so grass renews, To return another day. To nature he is true, ESOTERIC ERIC  Who bid him be this way?” Who taught him to be Wise?  He did not come upon my door, With questions I might answer.”  ESOTERIC ERIC ”       ESOTERIC ERIC       ” The Dance of Life is all around, And I am but a dancer. It was not I that penned the score, I know no more than you.”  “So, bid Farewell, put on your shoes, Your fate is yours to choose. But please remember as you leave, To share this news And kindly shut the door.”    ESOTERIC ERIC    .

2301-Our_Land-FKB.txt,"When the sun began sparkling on the water, FISHO gently  opened her eyes and yawned. She heard her mother's voice,  talking to her dad. FISHO who belonged to a family of fish  with yellow and black stripes on their bodies lived in a  stone cavity at the depth of 4 meters in a lake with her  father and mother, and her brother and sister named  FISHAL and FISHANT.  FISHO and her sister and brother were getting ready to go  to school. After they finished their breakfast, their mum  gave each of them a lunch box and an umbrella and warned  them to be very cautious.  “I am tired of this umbrella. How long should I hold it over  my head?”, said FISHAL.  “I am tired too. I can't see my surroundings properly”, said  FISHANT while swimming and spinning around herself.  “Sometimes, when I'm playing with the algae, my umbrella  falls out of my hand and I forget it,” said FISHO while  chewing the rest of the green algae left from their breakfast  and quickly getting the bubbles out of her mouth.  Laughing loudly, FISHAL said, “Yeah, a fish nearly hit her  head yesterday because she couldn't see”.  Daddy Fish and Mummy Fish were sad and anxious. Piles  of garbage had been dumped in the lake in the area where  they were living. Locals used small umbrellas when they  went out of their homes, holding them over their heads to  stay safe from the dangers of wastes including plastics,  bottles, and cans.  “Do we always have to carry an umbrella when going  out?”, FISHO asked Mummy Fish.  Suddenly, before she could answer, someone started  shouting and screaming.  Rubbing his claws on his head in desperation, the crab  father screamed that his youngest son has been stuck under  a plastic bag and was not able to free himself.  All went to the aid of Mr.Crab's son. All of them had taken  their umbrellas with them before leaving the house and  after going down a path where exotic garbage and objects  were falling on them reached Mr. Crab's house with  difficulty.  Mr.Crab's son was crying and struggling to free himself. He was shouting “Help me! I Can't Breathe!”.  The plastic bag was so big, heavy, and strong.  “I think I know someone who can save him,” Daddy Fish  reacted very quickly, explaining that Swordfish can tear off  the plastic bag with its sword.  They went to the Swordfish's house together. He was sitting on a little rock hill, quickly making bubbles with his mouth. “Swordy,” (by that he meant my very dear Swordfish)  “please save my son,” said Mr Crab to Swordfish. But as  soon as Swordfish heard about the incident, he told them  flatly ""This does not concern me"". Everyone could feel a  sneer in his voice. All were shocked by Swordfish's answer  and asked together “Why does it not concern you?”.  “I will never forget how Mr. Crab always acted like he  thought he was superior to me when we were young. He  always thought his claws were sharper than my sword. And  now that he is old, he has come to me for help! So this does not concern me!”, replied Swordfish while dancing around  with his sword.  Nobody knew what they should do. FISHO, FISHAL, and  FISHANT looked at each other and very quickly moved  their fins and started swimming toward Mr. Crab's son.  “If each of us takes a corner of the plastic bag and pulls it  apart,” suggested FISHO while standing beside the plastic  bag “he might be able to get free!”.  Lady Oyster who had just become aware of what was  happening, said “I cannot help you because I may break my shell but I will applaud for you”.  All helped pull on the four corners of the bag, and with  difficulty, removed the plastic bag from the head of Mr.  Crab's son. Mr. Crab's son came out breathless. All cheered  up and started dancing and rejoicing.  Mr. Crab was dancing happily moving his claws in the air. Mummy Fish bursts out laughing. “What is funny?”, asked  Lady Oyster. “A drink bottle cap is in your mouth! Here, let me take it out for you,” said Mummy Fish. “Hah? How I  did not understand?”, sighed Lady Oyster in relief.  Suddenly a scream was heard from afar.  It was Swordfish. All went to him. The entrance of  Swordfish's house had been blocked by pieces of clothes,  plastic bags, water and drink bottles in such a way that he  was not able to come out and just his voice, screaming for  help, could be heard.  FISHO joined the group and said,”""Oh My God! I went up  to the surface and can you guess what I saw? A new group  of people have come and are throwing their garbage into  the lake one after another.”  “I had told you not to go to the water surface. You are not  even safe beneath the surface and many disasters can still  happen to you here. Why did you go to the surface without  my permission?”, said Daddy Fish with anger.  “It is not the time for talk,” said Mr.Crab, he added  “Swordfish is stuck in his house, so hurry up.”  All went to the garbage and started removing pieces one by  one from the entrance of Swordfish's house. Lady Oyster  was rapidly clapping her shell to encourage them but with  each clap pieces of drink cap, plastic, and iron were  entering her mouth.  “I am sorry dear Mr. Crab. I shouldn't have behaved the  way I did,” Swordfish told Mr. Crab as soon as he was free. *** “I think we're no longer safe here, even with an umbrella,  we cannot continue living in this location. It is better to  move to another lake,” said Mummy Fish as she was taking little pieces of rubbish out of Lady Oyster's mouth.  The next day all the neighbours began packing and  preparing migrate to another lake. Somewhere on the way,  FISHO stopped and looked behind her. She gazed at the  stone cavity which once was their family home. She felt  sad.  “Don't worry darling...maybe a day will come when nobody throws garbage into the lake and you can come back  home,” whispered Lady Oyster into FISHO's ear.  FISHO smiled, saying “Lady Oyster! A button is in your  mouth! Let me take it out for you!”   - THE END - ","The story is about a family of fish living in a lake that has been polluted by garbage.

You know who you   are xxx“Puppy 3,” said Mrs Beaton, “are you still not going  to play with others?”  The tiny dachshund turned to look at the   lady who was speaking. He tilted his   little head to one side. She was the one who brought him food and cared  for him, so he quite liked her.  But she was also the one who took his   mummy away in the morning and only   brought her back in the   evening, and he didn’t   like that. Not at all. He didn’t know how he felt about her.  He didn’t know how he felt about her.Puppy 3 was only five weeks old. So, there  were lots of things he didn’t know. For example, he didn’t know he was going to  be called Siggy – mostly because nobody had  named him yet.  He’d heard Mrs Beaton say, “ I don’t name  my puppies because this makes it harder for  me to let them go to their forever home.” He wasn’t sure what that meant, either. He wasn’t sure what that meant, either. As usual, Puppy 3 (soon to be called Siggy)  sat by himself by the window.   He was thinking little puppy thoughts.  He was thinking about breakfast and his  mummy, while he watched the world  outside.So, Siggy - we’ll call him that now  - looked out of the window.  He kept watching, and around him, all his  own baby brothers and sisters were playing a  game they called Rough and Tumble!He was watching some robin redbreasts  outside. He saw a mummy, a daddy, and a  baby robin in a little nest in the oak tree at  the bottom of the garden. The parents were  feeding the baby some worms.  Siggy Siggy  wondered wondered  what the what the  wriggly things wriggly things  tasted like.tasted like. There were no actual rules in Rough and  Tumble. Everyone just piled in and jumped on  top of one another until they  all got tired. Whoever was  on top at the end, won  that round.They played this game a lot. Sometimes, a  dozen times a day. Then their mummy was  brought back by Mrs Beaton, and the puppies  used the last of their energy in excited delight  and a quick feed before they all slept deeply  and dreamed sweetly. During the day, while the other puppies  cavorted, Siggy mostly preferred to just watch  the world outside on his own.   He was a thoughtful little puppy. What he didn’t know was that the world outside  was about to visit him inside.   And change his world forever.And change his world forever.If he hadn’t been so interested in the robins  outside, he would have heard Mrs Beaton go  into the hallway. He would have heard the doorbell that called  her to the door. He would have heard people – two adults and  a little girl – say that they had come to look at  the puppies. Siggy didn’t even know he was called Siggy  yet, and he certainly didn’t know anything  about what was about to happen next… But when the door opened that morning, he  would remember what happened next for the  rest of his life. When the door did open, this time Siggy  heard it, and he looked around.He saw Mrs Beaton, but he was especially  interested in the man and lady and little girl  that walked into the room behind her.  Siggy thought they   looked nice, and he was “Where’s the proud mother?” asked the man. “Oh, Gladys?” replied Mrs Beaton. “ I take her  to another part of the house during the day.  She doesn’t like people handling her babies,  and when Gladys gets upset, all her puppies  do too. I like everything to be happy and calm  with my little sausages when people come to  look at them.”fascinated by the child’s bright red dress.fascinated by the child’s bright red dress.The adults began to speak amongst  themselves, and Siggy lost track of the  conversation. The girl gazed at the puppies, watching them  playing, without looking at Siggy.  So, after a little while, Siggy lost interest and  started to watch the robins again. The child continued to peer at all the tumbling  dachshund puppies, her face a happy mix of  delight and concentration. She giggled and  jiggled from one foot to the other   with a huge smile. with a huge smile. Then all at once, she turned her  head to look at Siggy.  The little girl stopped jiggling and stood still.  She tugged her mummy’s arm and spoke   eagerly to her parents, pointing at Siggy. Then the adults spoke to each other,   and they nodded and smiled.And she never looked away.And she never looked away.Siggy felt a small pair of warm hands take  hold of him gently, and then the little girl was  scooping him up. The girl looked into his tiny face and said,  “Hello, little puppy!” Siggy looked back into her eyes, and he felt  something very strange. A kind of sweet  confusion and a feeling of belonging that he  had only felt before when he saw his mummy. He didn’t know what this was. Like I said,  there were a lot of things he didn’t know. But  he knew that he liked the feeling. His big blue  eyes gazed up at the girl’s face above him.  Siggy had just fallen in love. Siggy had just fallen in love. The girl  bounded over  to Siggy. He  looked timidly  at her as she bent  down to pick him up.“Is that the one, Phyllis?” asked the lady.   “Do you like him?” “What’s his name?” asked the man. “That’s Puppy 3,” replied Mrs Beaton. “ I never  name them, or it breaks my heart to let them go.” She smiled sadly and then added, “And it only  confuses them if they have a name and then their  forever owner changes it.” “I think we should call him Sigmund!” said the lady.  “What do you think, Phyllis?” The little girl said, “ Sigman? ” She found Sigmund  difficult to say. Her parents laughed. “Not Sigman,  Phyllis! Sigmund!” her daddy replied.  “I like it.” “I know! Phyllis – what about Siggy?” said her  mum. “Can you say Siggy?” “SIGGY!” “SIGGY!” said Phyllis  delightedly.She looked at the little dachshund. “Hello,  Siggy!” she said softly. Siggy looked back at the girl, and he saw  himself reflected in her big green eyes. If he  had been able to explain, he’d have said that  those eyes were filled with love. His own eyes were filled with love too. “I’m Phyllis,” said the little girl. The baby dachshund made a sweet puppyish  noise in reply. The adults heard him make a  few soft little barking and snuffling sounds as  he wagged his tail furiously. But Phyllis heard him say, “Hello, Phyllis!” “Will you be my puppy?”“Will you be my puppy?”   Phyllis very earnestly asked  the tiny dachshund.Siggy looked deep into her eyes and seemed to nod  his little head as he made another puppy sound. “Yes!” he said. Phyllis heard him perfectly. “He said yes, Mummy! He said yes!” Phyllis cooed  and hugged the puppy close. “Are you going to be my forever human?”  whispered Siggy. “Yes, Siggy!” answered Phyllis, looking into   his eyes again. “ I’m always g oing to take   care of you. We’re going to have      such fun together!”such fun together!”“Aww! Look at them!” “Aww! Look at them!” said her mummy. “I think we have a winner!” laughed her daddy. The little girl and her little dog continued to have  eyes just for each other. Daddy and Mrs Beaton went into the next room,  and when he came back a few minutes later, he  was holding some papers. “He’s all yours, Phyllis!” he said. Phyllis felt her heart burst with joy. “Thank you!”  she said. “Thank you, Mummy and Daddy. I  promise I’ll always love him and care for him.” She brought Siggy over, and clutching him tightly in  one arm, she hugged her mummy, and her daddy  hugged them both.Siggy said goodbye to his little brothers and  sisters, who hardly noticed he was leaving,   but he didn’t feel sad. He didn’t know where he was going, and he  would alwaysalways  remember his mother, Gladys. “Let’s go home now,  darling,” said her mummy.But all the same,   he felt that if he was  going with Phyllis, then  he was going  he was going   home.home.The EndThe End Siggy and Phyllis return in Siggy and Phyllis return in Siggy the Soccer DogSiggy the Soccer Dog  andandAVAILABLE NOW!

FKB-Kids-Stories-Bee-Not-So-Busy.txt,"     1   All day long t he Busy -Bees flew from hive to flower and back to  hive, gathering pollen and nectar.          2   Their wings beat so fast that they caused a buzz!         3    “Look at us! We ’re humming with activity!” they sang.          4    Bee-Not-So-Busy was different from the other bees.         5    “Why don’t bees enjoy the garden like the other insects?” she  wondered.       6    “I’ll leave the hive and live like the beetles and the butter flies, the  ants and the grasshoppers!” she said.       7   She saw a beetle on a leaf. Beetles are smart. Instead of gathering  nectar and making honey, they eat the leaves on the plant,” she  said.       8   After dressing up in a beetle suit, she flew down beside the beetle .          9   Bee-Not-So-Busy took a big bite and almost vomited. “Yuck!

Observer_Effect-A_Christmas_Story-3-FKB.txt,"Ten-year-old science whizz Bradley Robinson pulled the backing paper off a pea-sized electrode and poked it at Jack’s cheek. Jack flinched. “Sit still, you idiot!” Bradley hissed as he pressed the electrode onto the skin below his brother’s left eye. He gently tugged the wire leading from it, then stepped back. “Right, give it a test.” Jack let his head drop forward and started to close his eyes, then snapped them wide open. He leapt from his chair. “Ow!” “Shhh!” Bradley whispered. “We don’t want to wake Mum and Dad. It worked, didn’t it? Your eyes stayed open.” “You didn’t say it would hurt,” Jack muttered as he sat back down. He turned to gaze at the fireplace. “Why are we doing this?” Bradley frowned. He couldn’t possibly have been that dumb when he was eight, could he? “I told you already. Father Christmas has to visit every kid in the world during only onenight—everybody knows that, right? But there’s no way he can do that under the laws of Newtonian Physics, so–” “Newt what?” Bradley shook his head. “Never mind. Anyway, as I was saying, he must be using Quantum Mechanics, harnessing quantum probabilities to distribute himself across all of space at once.” “You do know I haven’t a clue what you’re talking about?” Jack was more interested in sports than science, much to Bradley’s despair. Bradley sighed. “OK, the point of all this is that Santa can only get around if no one’s looking—that’s why our parents tell us we should go to bed early on Christmas Eve. Seeing Santa will make him freeze, unable to get to the next house. It’s as if your favourite footballer—Ronald, or whatever his name is—could be anywhere on the pitch, but you can’t tell where until you look.” Jack stared back blankly. Bradley continued, “It’s all to do with the Observer Effect.” He paused for a small snort of laughter—he really did enjoy showing off his knowledge. “Did you know that a lot of people, even expert physicists, get that confused with the Uncertainty Principle? How stupid is that? They’re totally different things.” Jack looked askance at his brother. “So what? And, what do you need me for?” Bradley put his fists on his hips, wincing as he snagged one of the leads attached to the electrodes firmly stuck to his own face. “You want loads of presents, don’t you? Having you here doubles the chance of catching Santa.”“But what’s the point of this?” Jack whined, pointing at the electrode. “It hurts.” “The Observer Effect says we change things when we observe–” Jack opened his mouth, but Bradley held up a hand before he could interrupt. “When we look at them. Santa zooms around at a bazillion miles an hour when nobody’s looking. If people catch a glimpse of him, he freezes—that’s the Observer Effect.” He scowled. “Actually, it’s a lot more complicated than that, but I wouldn’t expect a dimblebrain like you to understand. Anyway, as soon as someone who spots Santa blinks, he can escape, and all they’re left with is a story that no one’ll believe. And–” Jack screwed his face up “But–” “And if we don’t blink, he doesn’t get away. All we have to do is not close our eyes. Santa’s no match for my superior intellect.” Bradley rubbed his hands together. “We’ll demand more toys before we agree to let him go. Don’t you want that?” “But Mum says there are people who have nothing and we should be grateful for what we’ve got.” Bradley started to blow out his cheeks in exasperation, but remembered the electrodes just in time to avoid being shocked. “Well, you can be a goody-goody if you like, but I want more toys, and you’re going to help me.” “OK, I suppose. Ow!” Jack had let his eyelids droop again. “It’d be nicer if it didn’t hurt so much.” “Don’t be a baby!” Bradley snapped. “You can put up with it for a few hours. Just think about meeting Santa. We’ve only got one night to do this, or we’ll have to wait another whole year. Now, sit back and watch the fireplace.” The brothers had checked that the chimney wasn’t blocked —rather, Bradley had persuaded his smaller sibling to climb into the fireplace while he supervised, and stretch as high as he could up the chimney. Jack reappeared with a dusting of soot and cobwebs in his hair, and he sneezed, shocking himself again. Bradley wasn’t completely certain that chimneys were an essential part of Father Christmas’s quantum mode of travel, but he was taking no chances and made sure there was plenty of clear space between the fireplace and the tree for Santa to appear in.Both boys had been on their best behaviour for the past four weeks—well, to be honest, three and a bit; there had been that incident with Sally’s schoolbag and the rubber spider— to increase the likelihood of being on the nice list. Santa’s criteria seemed fairly lax, as he came every year regardless, but Bradley figured a boost wouldn’t hurt. They’d prepared well for their vigil. Jack did what his older brother told him to, raiding the kitchen cupboards and spending his pocket money on supplies, while Bradley constructed the shock device. Between their two chairs were a large pot of thick, black coffee, a six-pack of ultra- caffeinated energy drinks, several bars of bitter dark chocolate, also high in caffeine, and—as a final reserve—a packet of ground coffee and a spoon. And a large empty bottle each, so that they wouldn’t have to leave their posts. The two sat back, eyes glued to the space between fireplace and tree, and munched chocolate. Bradley drank lip- puckering coffee and talked about all the presents he’d demand. Jack sipped at chemical-tasting energy drinks and had no option but to listen to his brother. Occasionally, one or other boy would jerk as the electrodes shocked his eyes fully open again. Hours passed, and the coffee pot was empty. Soon, the energy drinks were all gone as well, and the other bottles were full. Bradley’s hand jittered as he reached for another piece of chocolate, and his heart was erratically smashing against his ribs. Jack struggled to speak under the influence of all the caffeine, “H-he’d b-better c-come s-soon. I th-think I’m g- going to th-throw up.”Bradley checked the clock on the mantelpiece, requiring several seconds to bring it into focus. “It’s al-almost d- dawn. N-not much l-longer n-now.” He clenched his jaw to stop his teeth chattering. What if his calculations were wrong? He let out a long breath. What if Santa had discovered their plans and moved them to the naughty list? No, Bradley was sure his plan was foolproof. He was going to  win Christmas! When he moved his gaze down from the clock, he saw a blurry figure blocking his view of the fireplace. Bradley instinctively blinked.  Zap—his eyes sprang wide open so quickly he felt a click inside his skull. “S-Santa,” he whispered. “No, not quite,” said a deep voice emanating from a thick hood—a black hood, not the expected red. Christmas tree lights twinkled off the blade of a long scythe. The tall figure leaned towards Bradley, poking him in the chest with a bony finger. “Too much caffeine’s bad for you, you know? Extremely bad, especially for greedy little boys.” As Bradley forced his eyes to focus on the pale face grinning at him, he heard a faint jingle followed by a thud. A cheerful voice boomed from the cloud of soot billowing from the fireplace. “Ho, ho, h– What do you think you’re doing?” There came the sound of angry teeth clacking together. “This one’s mine.” “You can’t do that! It’s Christm–” the new voice said. “I’ve got a quota to fill,” the first voice snapped.“Well, fill it somewhere else. You don’t get to take kiddies on my day or the Easter Bunny’s—we all agreed.” The first voice whined, “But look what he’s doing. He must be so high on your naughty list that he needs to be taught a lesson.” The second voice sighed. “Yes, he deserves punishment, but not that.” Paper rustled—someone was rummaging through what could only be a large sack of wrapped packages. “Look, Death old boy, I was going to give him just one present this year, but how about we cut a deal and you can have it instead?” More rustling. “And one of his brother’s.” After a burst of paper tearing noises, the first voice said, “Wow! Batman and Darth Vader limited edition action figures—look at the cloaks on those dudes. And the masks. OK, you have a deal, fat boy.” As the soot cloud dissipated, Bradley saw Father Christmas reach into his sack again, before handing Death another brightly-wrapped package. “I was saving this for later,” Santa said, “but since you’re here, you might as well have it now. Happy Christmas, old feller.”Death ripped the package open, then his jaw dropped. He gasped, “A Batman mask.” “Yep, from the movie. Look, it’s even signed.” Death’s blank eye sockets glistened. “That’s the nicest present anyone’s ever given me.” He put the mask on and gave Santa a hug. “Batman thanks you,” he said in a gravelly voice before vanishing. Bradley blinked, then jerked upright and yelped as he got zapped again. Santa turned at the sound. “Now, you, m’boy… No presents for you, unless you count living another day.” He eased the electrodes off Bradley’s face, then did the same for his brother, who was fast asleep, eyes wide open. Santa gently closed Jack’s eyes. Waving the bundle of wires, he said, “This was never going to work, you know. I use the chimney precisely for that cloud of soot. Nobody sees me on the way in and out. Today was a bit different, obviously.”He dropped the electrodes and picked up a handful of soot. “Normally, I’d vacuum this all up before I go, but I’ll leave it as a present for you.” He held the soot up. “This is what I leave naughty girls and boys with, not a lump of coal.” Santa blew the soot in Bradley’s face, obscuring his vision, then vanished leaving behind nothing more than the echo of a “Ho, ho, ho.” THE END About the Author Aside from a recently-published debut novel, the comic fantasy The Feather and the Lamp , L.N.

Bradley, who is a science enthusiast, has built a device that shocks them every time they close their eyes to prevent Santa from escaping. Bradley believes that Santa uses quantum mechanics to travel, which means he can only visit children when they are asleep and not looking. The brothers are determined to catch Santa and demand more toys before letting him go. However, Jack is less interested in the plan and more concerned about the pain caused by the shocking device.","['physics', 'poking', 'blinked', 'tugged', 'electrode']"

The-Argument-FKB-Stories.txt,"It was a cloudy, windy, sunny, mixed-up sort of day when Sara Hamilton marched out of the general store and ran smack into old Max McGregger.Old Max said, “I see you just bought an umbrella.”   Sarah nodded.  “Mama says it’s going to rain.  But I think the sky’s just foolin’ us.” “Could be,” old Max said.  “You never can tell who’s going to win the argument.”“Argument?” she asked. “Who’s arguing?” “Why, they’re  arguing, of course,” Max nodded toward the sky.  “You might not believe me, but my hearing used to be quite good in my younger days.   And one day I heard the rain bragging to the sun because he could make the seeds sprout.   And don’t get me wrong, he could.  The rain came down like a velvety curtain and softened the dirt. Next thing I knew,a little seed was sprouting up.”Then the sun pushed those rain clouds out  of the way.  I am more powerful, he said. The sun shimmered over the ground, and the little sprout stretched into a  beautiful flower.  See? The sun smugly announced, I have made it grow.Then the wind chimed in, I can make one flower turn into many! The wind blew his cold breath, and seeds from the flower twirled across the field.  Next thing I knew, the entire field was a garden of flowers.“About that time, my sister Emma came out of the house.   She saw the pretty field of flowers growing,ran right over, and started picking them. “Now she never could hear as good as me, so I don’t s’pose she heard what was saidafter she picked all those flowers.  But I did.” It was the sun who spoke up first: Look!  What we have made, the little girl has taken.She must also be powerful!The rain laughed. If I can make her sprout then she is no more powerful than the flowers.  The rain kissed her shoulders with soft, wet drops and Emma was tickled with joy.  She started jumping up and down in the puddles. See! the rain exclaimed when he saw her rise up,  Look at how she sprouts!After that it became a contest. The sun said, What you can make sprout, I can make grow. And he shined brightly down on Emma.  Emma stopped jumping around and held her hands up into the air, trying to reach the rain that was no longer there.  That was all the sun needed to see. He turned and gloated. See!  I have made her grow tall!It certainly must have looked that way because the wind bellowed, What you can make grow, I can spread across the field. He blew his cold breath over Emma.   What cold breath it was! Emma huddled down to keep herself warm, but it wasn’t long before she gave up and ran back into the house.    The wind calmed, and turned to the rain. Yes!  I am powerful.  I made her fly across the ground.Emma came back out of the house. She had Daddy’s umbrella to protect her. But the rain never noticed this. What he did notice was that there was only one of her.  He said, She has not grown into many!  You need to try again.       The wind blew on Emma like he had never blown before.  He blew so hard that she was lifted off the ground.And there she was, floating up  high under Daddy’s umbrella with  the wind coming up from below  pushing her higher and higher.Look at her! The wind screamed to the others. Not only can I make seeds spread  across the earth, but this one I have made grow TALL!   This was very upsetting to the sun. The wind wasn’t supposed to make things grow.That was the sun’s job.The rain decided that if the wind could do the sun’s job, then the rain could do the wind’s.  After the wind had let go of Emma, the rain cleared his throat with a thunderous boom.It rained so hard and fast, it formed a small river that swept Emma up off her feet and carried her away.  Emma was just fine with this; she sat inside Daddy’s umbrella and floated all the wayto the edge of town.  Wee! I could hear her hollering, YIpppee!   But the argument wasn’t over yet.It was the sun’s turn to see what he could do. He looked down at Emma and shined brighter than I’ve ever seen the sun shine.   It was shining so brightly, the river dried right up and Emma climbed out of the umbrella and started splashing around in the few puddles that were left. She jumped in every puddle leading back to the house.  While she was still jumping, the sun softened, turned to the rain and said, Yup, she’s sprouting.Old Max said, “That was the end of their arguing that day, but some days it seems they still haven’t gotten it figured out.” Sarah stared at Max. “You didn’t really hear all that, did you?”“I most certainly did.  If you don’t believe me,  just listen for yourself. When you hear the wind a’howling, it usually means the rain is taunting him. Then you’d better have your umbrella ready.”   Sarah started on her way home wanting to get there beforethe rain taunted the wind too much. It was already howling something awful.Before she had gotten to the end of the street, she heard the beating of thousands of feetrunning up behind her…and then the rain caught up.  Sarah opened her umbrellaand started skipping in the puddles.   From somewhere far above she thought she hearda voice laughing: Told you I could make her sprout!The END","an argument between the rain, sun, and wind over who is the most powerful. They demonstrate their power through a little girl named Emma. The rain makes the seeds sprout, the sun makes them grow, and the wind spreads the seeds across the field. They continue to argue over who is the most powerful, and Emma becomes the subject of their demonstration. Ultimately, the rain wins by making Emma fly through the air and carry her away. However, the sun manages to make her grow tall, and the wind makes her grow tall and spread across the field. The story ends with the rain, sun, and wind still arguing and the girl, Emma, enjoying the rain.","['clouds', 'wind', 'rained', 'rain', 'sun']"
The-Story-Of-Fighter-Planes-Kinara-Goyal.txt,"Fighter Planes Fighter planes first caught my interest when I read a book about fictional fighter pilots during the world   wars. I will give you a synopsis of the book later Fighter Planes History Models & Use Throughout Wars Planes have been an important part of our history   ever since the first propeller powered plane, created by the Wright Brothers came into existence in  1903. As many other scientific discoveries, the airplane too was quickly co-opted for warfare. Fighter aircraft were first used, in the Italo- Turkish war, in Libya, on October 23rd 1911. The  flight was a one-hour long, reconnaissance  mission conducted by  the Italians. This flight was  over enemy posts in  Libya. A reconnaissance  mission is a mission for gathering information,a spy mission if used to find  out about one’s  enemy. Ever since that time more and more advanced fighter planes have been tested  all over the world. One year after the Italo-Turkish war ended in 1913,   World War 1 started. During World War 1 the   Sopwith Camel F-1 had the most kills to it’s name.  It was a British plane. The most famous German  plane at the time, was the single-seater Fokker  Eindecker. During World War 2, the most famous British  plane was the Supermarines Spitfire. For Germany  it was the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and 10. And for  America it was the P-51 D-1s. During the 2nd World War, there were various types   of fighters, including the lightweight fighters, the   heavy bombers, light bombers which had some   bombing capability but were mainly fighters, and the medium bombers which were mainly bombers but   had more fighting ability than the heavy bombers.Junkers Jus and the Blackburn Stukas are examples of such bombers. Heavy bombers were slow and nearly defenseless,  so when completing operations they were only sent  with a fleet of fighters. These bombers were mainly   used for large scale bombing, like the time when the   Americans bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Inspite of their mass production during the World   Wars, nowadays the nuclear powered guided  missiles that can be equipped on light-weight and  speedy fighter jets, have mostly replaced them. Air Operations Battle Of Britain The Battle of Britain was a Nazi bombing campaign   against the United Kingdom. The RAF (Royal Air   Force), the FAA (Fleet Air Arm) and the Royal  Navy fought to prevent the Luftwaffe which is the  German Air force, from gaining air superiority. Airsuperiority implies an advantage over enemies when it comes to air missions. The Luftwaffe was hoping that after they gained  air superiority the United Kingdom would agree to  a peace treaty favouring the Axis powers. During  the battle, there were many ground, air, and naval   operations, but we will focus on the air operations   only. During theBattle Of Britain ,The Blitz, an operation conducted by the Germans, was their main attempt, to gain air supremacy over the English channel. Air  supremacy is the highest degree of air superiority. This attempt to gain air superiority failed and the Luftwaffe lost a lot  of aircraft. The Blitz mostly damaged London although the   bombing was conducted in the whole of the  country. It is not clear how long The Blitz lasted but most sources agree that it started on  7th  September  1940.The main reason the Germans wanted air supremacy was to conduct Operation Sea Lion . To gain air  superiority the Luftwaffe held major training   programs, made new specialized weapons and even   modified transport ships. On 16th  July 1940, Adolf Hitler announced the conditions for Operation Sea Lion. They were: The RAF should be ‘beaten down’ so badly that they cannot make an aggressive move. British mines were to be swept away and   German mines were to block both sides of the Strait of Dover. The costal zone between occupied France and England must be bombed by heavy artillery. The British squadrons must be damaged or destroyed by torpedoes. Even though Hitler announced the Battle of  Britain after Operation Sea Lion , the operation is  still considered a part of the battle, because the  battle campaign started before the operation was   conducted. However, since the Germans failed togain air superiority, the operation was postponed  by Hitler indefinitely. Operation Strangle After Benito Mussolini died in April 1945, the   Germans implemented Operation Axis to prevent the Allied forces from getting a foot hold on Italy after   Mussolini’s execution. The Italian Campaign is a series of four strikes   conducted by the Allies, to rid the German army from Italy. Operation Strangle was the fourth airstrike   conducted by the allied forces to rid the German   army from Italy. The goal of the mission was to   bomb and destroy or damage all essential resources en route for the German army, thus forcing them to withdraw from Italy and prevent a ground attack in the U.K.At first, the Allied powers did not want to send   troops into German territory and that was why they executed a pure air operation. The Allies failed in the overrated objective of the   campaign, but they crippled the Germans enough to send troops into the German territory. The bombing lasted 8 weeks. Throughout that time, supplies for the Germans could not be sent by   railways or airplanes and they had to be sent by   trucks, further inconveniencing the Germans. Fighter Planes Through The Ages Over the past hundred years fighter planes have not   only lost their propellers and replaced them with jet   engines, but they also have caught the attention of   movie producers and video game creators. I have   watched the movie Top Gun many times and my  dad bought me a video game in which the player  flies a jet plane.","This text provides a brief history of fighter planes, starting from the first propeller-powered plane created by the Wright Brothers in 1903, to the advanced fighter planes used today. The focus is on the use of fighter planes in wars, including World War 1 and World War 2, and specific battles such as the Battle of Britain and Operation Strangle. The text also briefly discusses different types of bombers and the importance of air superiority. The author also mentions the popular movie Top Gun and video games that feature fighter planes.","['aircraft', 'airplane', 'planes', 'airplanes', 'luftwaffe']"

2210-a-cat-for-santa-FKB.txt,"Let me tell you what happened one day in the Enchanted Forest. The Dark Fairy was up to her tricks  and a kitten got lost and couldn't  remember where she lived.  And so it began...Four little kittens were outside their home looking for their mittens. The Dark Fairy came and turned  into a blue butterfly. One of the kittens, a white one, began to chase the butterfly, as kittens will do.The butterfly led the kitten to a deep, dark well. When the kitten jumped up on the well to catch the  butterfly, it turned back into the Dark Fairy and startled her. She fell into the well.The fairy laughed and flew away. The kitten was at the bottom of the well, wet and scared. She was  crying,  “Meow, Meow.” She had bumped her head on the way down.It happened that day that the Sugar Plum Fairies had come to the forest to visit their sister, the Purple  Fairy.  They heard the kitten crying and flew to the well.The Pink Fairy waved her wand and the kitten rose out of the well. She was  now cold, wet and scared.  The Blue Fairy asked, “Who put you in the well?”  “I don't know. I remember chasing a blue butterfly  then I found myself in the well. ” replied the kitten.The Orange Fairy said, “I bet it was the Dark Fairy. She is wicked and likes to disguise herself in blue. I  wish she were not our sister.” Yes, besides the Purple Fairy, the Dark Fairy is also their sister.The Green Fairy asked, “Where do you live?” The kitten, still shaking from the cold, answered “I don't  know. I don't remember” The Orange fairy asked, “Would you like to live with us at the North Pole?”  The kitten said she would love to.Off they flew to the North Pole. The kitten magically flew too. Can you guess how that happened?  The fairies  would have to visit their sister another day.When they arrived, Mrs. Claus saw the kitten and said, “Oh, Santa loves kittens.

Santa will be thrilled.” The Green Fairy said, “If it is alright with her.” The kitten looked at  Mrs. Claus, smiled, and said, “Yes, I would like that.” Mrs. Claus was overjoyed.When they arrived home, Santa was surprised to see Mrs. Claus with a cat. He asked, “Who might this  kitten be?” Mrs. Claus replied, “She doesn't have a name yet. I got her for you.” Santa laughed, “Ho  Ho Ho, thank you so much I love cats. What should we call her?” Mrs. Claus suggested, “How about Iris because her eyes are the color of the iris flower?” Santa laughed again, “Ho Ho Ho, what a splendid  name.” Santa's dog, Fudge, was not sure having a cat in the house was a good idea.In a while, Iris and Fudge became best of friends.

If they are 'not out'  they are 'in'. “  said Mrs. Claus. Where do you think the ingredients are? In the kitchen what is 'near'  and could have something put 'in'.Iris knew, right away.

Tanias-Diwali-Celebration-FKB-Stories.txt,"Tania Celebrates Diwali Tania was really excited. The last day of school was finally over. Tania's Diwali vacation had begun. Diwali was still a few days away. But there was a lot of preparation to do. Diwali is the Indian festival of lights. It is celebrated with sweets, lights, decorations, games and firecrackers. Tania was now old enough to enjoy it all and she had been looking forward to it for a while. Mama had planned some fun activities for Tania. First on the agenda was to decorate diyas. Tania asked ""Mama, what is a diya?""Mama said ""A diya is an oil lamp made of clay. We pour oil into the clay bowl and make a wick from cotton. When we light the oil soaked cotton, the flame lights up the area around. It is very pretty. The clay lamps are plain and brown, so we are going to paint them."" Mama and Tania sat on a large plastic mat on the living room floor anddecorated the lamps with various designs. They used a lot of the flashy silver and gold colours which would shine beautifully in the lamp light. Diwali week is the time to do some house cleaning and decorating. Tania and mamaspent a morning cleaning up and arranging cupboards and drawers. So in the afternoon they decided it was time for some fun. Mama told Tania they would be making a ""Rangoli"". She saw Tania's curious, puzzled expression and explained, ""A Rangoli is a design made on doorsteps as a welcome sign. We are going to use rice flour to make it."" Mama took some rice and put it in the grinder. Tania pressed the button and made rice flour. Then mama and Tania took the rice flour to the doorstep. ""Now what do we do mama?"" asked Tania. Mama said, ""Sprinkle the rice powder to make some nice design like this flower here.""Mama also used a little bit of some coloured powders she had bought. Tania and mama had an enjoyable afternoon making a lovely floral Rangoli. But enough about decorating. Diwali would not be complete without tasty Indian sweets. Mama had bought some dry- fruit sweets from the sweet shop.But mama always made gulab jamuns at home. Tania helped mama make a dough consisting of milk powder, flour, baking powder and cream. They then made little round balls of dough the size of marbles and deep fried them till they were golden brown. Mama also made a sugar syrup flavoured with rose water. Once the fried balls of dough cooled a little, mama and Tania put them in the syrup to soak.Soon it was the night before Diwali. Diwali is on the night of the new moon, so the night before Diwali is the darkest night of the month. It is believed that the ghosts and spirits prowl the earth on that night. So in some parts of India it is customary to light 14 diyas and place them all over the house to ward off the ghosts. Tania and mama lit their beautifully decorated diyas and placed them all over thehouse. On Diwali morning Tania woke up early. Grandma and grandpa were coming in the afternoon. Mama made a snack of ""pani- puri"" and ""dahi-puri"" for everyone. Tania helped set up the table with the puris, curd, mashed potatoes, tamarind chutney and of course the super tasty ""pani"":  water flavoured with cumin, rock salt and mint coriander chutney.Grandma and grandpa arrived around 2:00. Traditionally the family spent Diwali afternoon playing cards. But to include little Tania, this Diwali they played ""Uno"". Instead of the usual betting the victor got to collect a certain amount of candy from the rest at the end of each game. Tania thoroughly enjoyed herself. She was an expert at Uno andcollected a good amount of candy. Everyone chatted and ate pani-puri while playing Uno. This was Tania's first time eating pani-puri and she found it to be a messy and enjoyable experience. They also ate gulab jamuns and other sweets. The afternoon passed by quickly with everyone having such a good time. Soon the sun had set and it was time for fire crackers. This was what Tania had beenlooking forward to most of all. The housing society had set aside some space for the children to safely light crackers.Tania lit sparklers, fountains and a rotating ground fire cracker called a zameen-chakra. Last year mama had only let her watch. It was so much more fun to actually light the crackers. That night Tania went to bed happy and tired. It was the best, most exciting day she had ever had.","Tania, a girl who is excited for Diwali, the Indian festival of lights. Tania and her mother decorate diyas, make a Rangoli, clean the house, and make sweets. On the night before Diwali, they light 14 diyas to ward off ghosts.

FKB-Kids-Stories-I-Really-Want-A-Dog....An-Introduction-to-Dog-Ownership-for-Children.txt,"I really wanted a dog.  I Really, really, really wanted a dog!!! But Mum said, first I needed to  learn more about dogs.  “Do you know how to look after a dog?”  She asked me. I asked my big sister if she could help me look up facts about dogs on the internet.  We found out that:  Dogs need to have a healthy diet.  Dogs need lots of water. Dogs need regular exercise.  Dogs need a place to sleep. Most dogs love playing games.  Dogs need to have a security gate – for their protection and other peoples!  “And, what type of dog would you like?” Mum asked me. I asked my big sister again, if she could help me look it up on the internet.  Border Collie? Boxer? Basset Hound? A Pomerian is really fluffy, very cute, with lots of energy. It would need to be brushed a lot, and Mum might get mad about the hair. A great dane has a gentle nature and is very intelligent. But I don't think he would fit in our small house; or in our small car if we had to take him to the vet.    An Alaskian Husky is a very nice dog,  but it would be really hot for him in summer,  since we don't live in Alaska.  I guess we'd have the same problem  with a Canadian Eskimo Dog.  An Airedale terrier was originally bred to hunt otters;  we don't have many otters around here.  A Finish Lapphund, originally bred to herd reindeer,  is very popular in Finland,  but we don't have many reindeer here either.  Miniature Schnauzers are spunky guard dogs,  but they tend to bark more  than bite.  Spaniels are warm natured,  friendly, and loyal, and make great pets.  How about a Russian Spaniel? Would I need to speak to him in Russian? The Shar Pei was originally bred  as a place guard dog in China,   but, we don't have a palace.  What about a Broholmer? Or an Australian Terrier? Or  a Czechoslovakian wolf-dog? I'd like a poodle, but they also have a lot of curly fur to look after.  Perhaps a labradoodle – it's a cross between a labrador and a poodle.  Labradors or Retrievers are kind, friendly, and outgoing dogs, they also love helping people.  They are the most common dog breed used to help blind people.  A labrador might be a nice dog to have  – if he's not too busy helping blind people. Should I get a puppy or an adult dog? Puppies are cute, but need lots of training.  Older dogs are trained,  but may have learned bad habits. Mum had one more question for me, do you know how much a dog will cost??!! Luckily me and my sister had already thought about that one. And looked it up.  A pure breed can be quite expensive, but there are lots of animal welfare groups where a dog can be adopted,  and this helps out a pet without a home.   To adopt a dog you need to pay for the dog's doctor bills to make sure he is healthy and has all his vaccination shots.  Good quality dog baskets and toys can be found  at the supermarket  or bulk stores, or at the animal welfare shelter.  As can good quality dog food. Don't forget about the fence if you don't have one. Some countries may require a dog license.  I learnt dogs are really fun to have, but also a big responsibility. Mum says she's thinks I am ready for a dog now.  Mum and I will go down to the animal shelter to see if I can find a dog that loves me as much as I love him or her.   I hope you enjoyed learning about dogs as much as I did.

It was  inhabited by a little kingdom of frogs. Their K ing was a  good and kind leader  but the concern for his people grew  daily. Their food and other resources decreased by the growing  pollution  that was  spreading through T he Ponds. He had  sent  out his best men  to find a new h ome for his people , but they  had returned w ithout finding a new haven for the kingdom.     A glimmer of hope came int o sight as he watched the last frog   return from his  journey.   He immediately met with the King and  claimed that he found a  new home  for the frog kingdom. A meeting was called in the  centre of T he Ponds.     “I am now the Rich Frog, as my new home is filled with food  and clean water,” said the Rich Frog. “You do not have to live  like this: our homes are polluted and there is no food left, follow  me and you will live a care free life with added protection,” he  continued while pointing to a black bird in the sky.   “That is my new friend and he will make sure that no harm will  come to us.”       T        There was nothing the King could do as he watched his fellow  frogs leave him one by one.   “I am sorry your majesty , but he has promised us a life beyond  this pond : a life of a full tummy and a clean body ,” said one of  the frogs as he passed the King.     “There is no need for apologies ,” said the Rich Frog before the  King could answer. “You can‟t provide for your people and  therefore you must be de -crowned !”   He took the crown from the K ing and placed it on his own  head.   “Now  my p eople , follow me, let us not waste any more time at  this dump our new home awaits !” exclaimed  the Rich Frog.     In the village close to T he Ponds lived a boy named Dan. He  was playing with the rest of the boys  from the village,  but was  struggling to hit his  target with his slingshot.   “No not again !” he said as the stone missed the plastic bottle  once again. The other boys  were laughing at him.     “You should throw that slingshot away Dan, you will never hit  the target ,” said one of the boys.   They are probably right he thought as he walked away  from the  laughing crowd.   “Dan ! Wait!” he heard one of the older boys  call to him .  “Yes, Kyle ?” said Dan.   “Listen here, you have to ignore them. You just started to use  the slingshot, you just have to keep on practising. I n time you   will hit your target ,” said Kyle .  “Thanks , but I think the others are right, I just can‟t do it ,” he  said as he st alked off.     Dan decided to go for a walk to get out of the village for a  while. It was a hot day and he n eeded to cool down. I‟ll go to  The Ponds it is the pe rfect place to cool down and get rid of this  thing , he thought as he placed the slingshot  in his pocket.     Dan walked over the hill and admired the lush green trees and  plants that covered i t like a blanket. He instantly  felt relaxed, but  when he reached T he Ponds he was completely in shock.     There was litter everywhere and the once clear pools  were now a  dark brown colour. What could‟ve happened to The P onds?  Who would do this, he thought? “It must have been the animals  that live here, now that makes sense,” he said out loud.            “I beg to differ ,” he heard. He looked around , confused . There  was no one at T he Ponds but him.   “I am down here human ,” he heard. Dan  looked down and in  the water he saw what looked like a green face with big white  eyes. Dan was puzzled.   “Let me help you there ,” said the green thing as he emerged out  of the murk y wate r. Then Dan heard a croak sound .   “A frog, a talking frog !” he said.     “Yes , that is correct; I am only a frog now. I used to be more  than that , but that was the good old days ,” said the frog as he  hopped on to a rock.   “What do you mean?” asked Dan.   “I used to be the King of the frogs , but my people have  abandoned me for a life of food and clean water , but I don‟t  blame them ,” answered the frog as  he explained to Dan what  happened. “Now I am all alone in this polluted pool , but  enough about me . What is your name boy?” continued the King  frog.    “I am Dan and I have noticed that T he Ponds have indeed  changed a bit ,” said Dan.   “Now that is an understatement. It is a complete mess and your   kind is responsible !” said the K ing, irritated.   “What do you mean „my kind ‟?” asked Dan .  “The humans‟ , boy, they  are responsible. They come to T he  Ponds , but when they leave , their dirt and litte r stays behind. We  can‟t clean T he Ponds by ourselves and now it is almost  uninhabitable ,” said the King frog.    “Ribbit, Ribbit!” they heard.   “Oh he llo James, you have returned ,” said the K ing to the  approaching frog. James stopped suddenly when he saw the  human.   “Don‟t worry, come closer , he is a friend and  we can trust him ,”  said the King frog. “James, th is young boy‟s name is Dan and  Dan this is James. He was my right hand  frog once,” said the  King frog.     “I still am , your majesty ,” he said , staring at Dan suspiciously. “I  only left to spy on the Rich frog and to see where he took our  fellow frogs ,” James continued.    “What did you find?” asked Dan.   “The Rich frog was dishonest , your majesty ,” said James ,  ignoring Dan. “He took the frogs to become his slaves. They are  building his kingdom for him ; there is very little food and water .  For now they wi ll survive , but I fear not for long.     “We have to save them ,” said the King frog.   “Wait a second , frog. Why would you want to help them?” Dan  asked. “They left you for what they thought would be a better  life. I say let them be slaves because they ch ose to go with the  Rich frog,” Dan  continued.   “Actually , it‟s not „frog‟! It‟s „your majesty ‟,” said James sternly.   “I apologise , „your majesty ‟, but why would you want to save  them?” asked Dan.     “They are good frogs;  they had no other choice  but to go with  the Rich frog. I t‟s not their fault  that they were deceived , but  they need our help and we help where we can , Dan. There are  times when we have to look to the greater good for all ,”  answered the King frog.      “I understand ,” said Dan.   “It was nice meeting you , Dan, but James and I have to hop  along now, we have a long journey ahead of us ,” said the King  frog.   “Ribbit ,” confirmed  James.      Dan stood frozen for a moment , pondering as he watched  them  leave and then he shouted, “Wait , I‟m comi ng with you!”    “Thank you , but this is not your battle boy ,” said the King frog.   “I can be of help , your majesty, I can carry you to make your  journey quicker, ” said Dan.   “He has a point , your majesty , we can reach the other frogs  sooner with the boy‟s help ,” said James.  “Splendid, then I thank you for your generous offer , Dan,” said  the King frog. Dan bent down and reached out both hands , one  for each frog to climb on to, and he started to walk in the   direction that James pointed out .     After some time t hey reached an area filled with rocks . “We are  close now ,” said James.   “But there are only rocks here, ” said Dan.   “They are behind those rocks ,” said James , pointing with his  little green , webbed  finger.   “Dan , you can put us down now ,” said the King frog. “We will  be going alone from here , Dan. Please stay hidden behind the  rocks . We will call you if needed ,” said the King. Then the two  frogs hopped out of  Dan‟s sight.             Behind the rocks the  frogs were working hard , building the Rich  frog‟s new home. “Faster ! We don‟t have all day ! The straw must  be gathered before sun s et!” the Rich frog instructed . He was  sitting on his so - called throne in the shade shouting orders.     “The frogs all  look very tired. Why don‟t you let them rest while  we talk ?” said the King to the Rich frog as he approached him.   “They are my frogs  now and I say when it is time to rest. What  are you doing here anyway, have you decided to join my cause?”  asked the Rich frog. “Actually I came to fetch my fellow frogs ;  they are coming home with me !” instructed  the King.     The frogs started to cheer. “Or der, Order !” bellowed  the Rich  frog.  “There is no need for that behaviour , you are not going  anywhere ! Have you forgotten what has happened to T he  Ponds ?” he continued.  The smi les disappeared from the frogs‟  faces  as they remembered.     “Yes , that is true ; The Ponds are  not what it used to be . At least ,  though,  with me the y will have their freedom. So  Rich frog , let  my people go !” said the King frog.   “No, they are mine now ! They will not leave !” said the Rich  frog.     “I will not ask again , Rich  frog, let my people go !” said the King  frog as he grew angrier .   “I said no!  I will have to make you understand that you have no  say here ,” said the Rich frog.     He whistled at the black bird circling above them. Immediately  the bird made eye contact with the R ich frog. “Eat him, my  pet,” the Rich frog commanded.   The bird immediately stopped circling, looked straight at the  King frog and swooped down towards him.        “Look out , your majesty !” James sh outed as he tried to reach the  King, but he was too late. The bird had gotten to the King first  and with a flap of his wings he lifted the King higher and higher  up into the sky.   “Now do you see what wi ll happen if you do not obey me? Now  back to work! You too James;  this is no place for he roes.” said  the Rich frog.     Suddenly a dark shadow appeared. It nearly covered the entire  area where the frogs were gathered. “It‟s a human !” the frogs  shouted.   “A what?” said the Rich frog in complete shock . “But that is  impossible , they do not come to the rocks ,” he continued.   Dan stood above the frogs like a giant taking the slingshot out  of his pocket.     “Run for your lives, he is not a friendly human; he ha s a  weapon !” the frogs screamed in fear . It was chaos the frogs we re  hopping  in every direction. “Wait everyone , he will not hurt us ,  he is here to help !” James shouted  trying to calm the masses .      Dan picked up a stone , placed it into his slingshot, pulled the  sling back and aimed it at the bird. The rock flew through the  air, but missed the bird . Immediately he picked up another  stone. It  shot through the air , but again it  missed the bird. He  was about to  give up when he remembered Kyle ‟s words to him :  “Keep on practising and in time you will hit your target .”  He picked up another rock and aimed it at the circling bird once  more.     This time the rock hit the black  bird on the stomach. “Yes, I got  him,” said Dan excitedly , but his victory didn‟t last long . The  bird let out a cry of pain and dropped the King frog. Oh no ,  though t Dan as he watched the bird f ly off and the King frog  fall at a rapid speed towards the ground.     The frogs were all frozen  as they watch  the King fall. Dan  moved as quickly as he could , cupping his hands to catch the  King frog.  A sigh of relief came from  the gathered frogs as the  King landed safely in Dan‟s hands.   “Why thank you Dan, you saved my life ,” said the King frog.   “It‟s a pleasure your majesty ,” said Dan as he placed the K ing  safely on the ground.   The King  hopped to the Rich frog and said , “Now as I was  saying earlier, I want you to release my people .”  “The answer is still no ,” said the Rich frog stubbornly.     Dan couldn‟t take it anymore . He walked to the Rich f rog and  lifted his leg and said,  “If you do not se t them free I will step on  you.”   “No you will not! ” said the Rich frog.  “Your majesty , may I go ahead and end his life ?” Dan asked the  King frog. “Yes you may , Dan,” said the King frog winking at  him.   Then Dan slowly moved his lifted foot down towards the Rich  frog.        “Okay, o kay, spare my life and take your people ,” said the R ich  frog. “Now leave and take your human with you ,” he continued.     There is only one more thing. You do not deserve to wear that ,”  said James as he took the crown from the Rich frog‟s head and  handed it back  to the King. “Ah, yes , that feels good”  said the  King frog as he placed the crown back on his head.   His frogs surrounded him apologising for leaving him and  thanking him for not forgetting about them.   “There is no need for apologies  now. Shall we hop along  home ?” asked  the King frog .  “Your majesty , what do we do with the Rich frog?” Dan asked.     “Nothing Dan , he has lost today‟s battle . That should be  punishment enough ,” answered the King frog.   “If you say so , your majesty ,” said Dan , but he turned to the  Rich frog and said , “If you ever try to come near their kingdom  or try to hurt them , my foot and I  will find you that‟s a promise!   Do you understand frog?”    “Yes I do ,” said the  defeated Rich frog  as he watched them  leave.     “Well that went well ,” said  Dan as they reached T he Ponds.   “Indeed it did , but we can‟t stay here Dan , there is nothing here  for us so we will have to find another home ,” said the King  frog.   “Don‟t be too hasty about leaving your majesty . I have a plan ,”  said Dan. He greeted the K ing and the other frogs , and started  his journey home over the hill.     Days passed at T he Ponds and there was  no sign of Dan.   “I am afraid he is not coming back , your majesty ,” said James.   “I think you might be right , James. We will have to start our  prepa rations . We will leave T he Ponds in a day or two. Please  send the message to our fellow frogs ,” said the King.     “Croak, croak, c roak,” they heard from the lookout  rock.   “That was three croaks ; that must mean humans are  coming ,”  said James.   “It‟s p robably another picnic. C ome on James , we have a lot to  get in order ,” said the King.  “Your majesty, your majesty !” one of the frogs shouted as he  came hopping towards the K ing.  “What has got ten you so rattled?” the K ing asked  the  approaching frog.   “It‟s Dan , he has returned with more humans ,” answered the  frog.   “Now this I have to see ! Come on , James ,” said the King.     “Well hello Dan, you have returned ,” said the King.   “Yes , your majesty , these are my friends. They also live in the  village nearby and whe n I told them what happened to T he  Ponds they immediately said that they would help ,” said Dan.   “It is time to take responsibility for what we have done. We  apologise ; we didn‟t know that this would happen to T he Ponds.  We are he re to clean The P onds ,” said K yle as the rest of the  group all nodded their heads in agreement and started to get to  work .    It took a while for T he Ponds to regain its former glory , but in  the end it did , thought Dan w hile he was enjoying the clear  Ponds. “The water is clear; the frogs  are resting on the re  - grown flower stools. I don‟t know how to thank you , Dan,” said  the King frog.   “There is no need , your majesty;  this was done for the greater  good for all.”        The End                                 ","Dan and the Frog tells the tale of a frog kingdom living in The Ponds, which was once a beautiful and lush area but had become polluted due to human activity. The king of the frog kingdom had sent out his best men to find a new home for the kingdom, but they had returned without success. However, a frog named the Rich Frog claimed to have found a new home, filled with food and clean water, and convinced many of the frogs to leave The Ponds and follow him to this new location. The Rich Frog then took the crown from the king and declared himself the new ruler. Meanwhile, in a nearby village, a boy named Dan was struggling to use his slingshot, and the other boys were making fun of him. Feeling discouraged, Dan went for a walk to cool down and ended up at The Ponds, where he encountered the King Frog. The King Frog explained the dire situation to Dan, and Dan realized that human activity was responsible for the pollution. The story teaches about the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and caring for the environment. It also highlights the power of leadership and the importance of working together towards a common goal.","['frog', 'frogs', 'ponds', 'pond', 'kingdom']"

How-Do-Aeroplanes-Fly-FKB-Stories.txt,"Sarla liked to watch birds fly.  One day, during science class, she looked out of the window and saw an eagle gliding in the sky. How happy the bird must be! She also liked to see planes flying.   “Here, what's your name? Should you not be looking at the board?” asked the new teacher in Sarla's class. Sarla got up hastily and said, “Sorry Madam, I was watching an eagle. I wish we could fly like a bird, or like an aeroplane....” “What is your name?” “Sarla.”“Oh how nice! Do you know that Sarla was the name of the first Indian women pilot too?  My name, Hamsa, means a swan. Swans are one of the largest flying birds, you know,” said the teacher.  “ You must spend some time in the library, Sarla. I'm sure there are many books about birds and flights, and machines that fly like aeroplanes.”   Over the next few days, Sarla happily learnt a lot about birds, and about aeroplanes.Sarla learnt that  human beings can fly too, but not like birds. We can  fly to any city in the world in an aeroplane, one of mankind’s greatest inventions.  With the help of this great machine, we can also experience the joy of being airborne. Birds are aerial creatures that do not need an external machine to fly. Usually, a bird's wings are bigger than the rest of its body.  The wings are very light, making it possible for birds to fly.Aeroplanes are huge and very heavy. Just like birds, aeroplanes have wings on both their sides which help them to fly. The wings of the plane are shaped just like those of birds - curved on the top and flat on the bottom which helps them to fly high up in the sky.Birds flap their wings to fly, but of course we  have never seen an aeroplane flapping its wings! Birds flap their wings as they use the wind to push their body upwards.  Aeroplanes also fly with the help of the force of the wind. This machine uses the engine inside its body to create wind that flows below the plane.An engine is a very strong machine which acts like the brain of the plane. Just like a bird uses its mind and logic to navigate its flight, engines help planes to push them above the ground and to help them move forward. When the plane’s engines burn fuel, they release hot gases at high speeds which push on the air behind the engine, moving the plane forward.Cars and other vehicles with engines move forward too. But they cannot go up in the sky like planes. The wind flows over and under their wings which are shaped like birds’ wings and lifts the plane into the sky and keeps it there.  Planes also have tails, just like birds, to keep them steady and help them change direction. ٴPlanes need big long roads to take off and land. These long roads are called runways and planes need to travel very fast on the runway before they can take off into the air. Planes need to gain a lot of speed to lift off in the air.  Most aeroplanes can take off only if they are moving fast enough. The runway is an important part of the airport as it gives aeroplanes enough time to increase their speed and ultimately take off.Planes know where they have to go because they are steered by pilots. The pilots control the plane from a place in the front of the aeroplane called the cockpit. They keep in contact with the airport (a place from where the planes take off and land) through very accurate and modern devices. Just like there are signals and police to help us on the roads, there are air traffic controllers who tell pilots when and where to fly; and when it is safe to take off or land.   A plane is actually a giant bird. It is not only shaped like a bird, it also allows us to fly, though not  like birds!  Sarla wants to be a pilot and fly aeroplanes when she grows up.Did You Know?   India’s first aircraft was the Harlow which first flew in July 1941. The first pilot license in India was awarded to JRD Tata in February 1929 by the Aero Club of India and Burma.The fastest jet aircraft in the world is the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird which flies at a speed faster than the speed of sound. Sarla Thakral was the first Indian woman to fly an aircraft. She was also the first woman pilot to accumulate over 1000 hours of flying.Let's take off! Have fun with friends with these activities: 1. Make paper planes and see whose plane goes the farthest. Is it the paper or the way it has been made that makes a paper plane go faster?  Observe what happens when each  plane is launched. Is there a difference if you blow over, or into or under the plane before you shoot it off?   2. Fly-Don't fly Game: Get a group of friends to 'fly' around the room, without touching each other. The den stands in a corner and calls out the names of flying or non-flying objects. When a non-flying object (like table)  is called, the 'planes' must 'land' (sit down). Whoever makes a mistake is the next den.This is a Level 3 book for children who are ready to read on their own. (English) How Do Aeroplanes Fly?

Wikijunior_Big_Book_of_Fun_Science_Experiments.txt,"shape. Newtonian liquids, like oil or water, usually take the shape of the container they are in.  Non-Newtonian fluids like Oobleck are sometimes liquids and sometimes solids. If you have ever melted chocolate without stirring it, you will notice that the squares of chocolate  hold their shape until you stir them up. Melted chocolate is also a non-Newtonian fluid. 1. The Experiment 1.1 Safety As with all experiments, you should talk to an adult before trying to make Oobleck. You may need  permission to use the ingredients.  Oobleck is safe to touch; however, it can be  very messy. You should wear an apron to keep your clothes  clean. If you get Oobleck on your clothes or on the floor, you can easily clean them up with water. 1.2 What You Need Water A cup of cornstarch A bowl A spoon That's it, isn't that easy! 1.3 Instructions Put about a cup of cornstarch into the bowl. Pour about a cup and a half of water into the bowl and stir. All the cornstarch should be covered in the water. There should be no dry cornstarch visible. If there is dry cornstarch, add a  tiny bit more water and stir again. Keep adding a tiny bit of water and stirring until all the cornstarch is covered in water. The mixture should look wet but be difficult to stir, as if you are trying to stir a solid. Dig in! Note: If your oobleck starts getting too dry, just add a little more water and stir it again. 2. Things to Try Pick up a handful of oobleck and squeeze it in your fist. Does it feel like a solid or liquid? Now open your hand and hold it over the bowl. What happens? Now is the oobleck a solid or a liquid? When is the Oobleck a solid? When is it a liquid? Find a small object such as a plastic toy and attempt to float the object on the Oobleck. Can you do it? 3. What is Happening? The cornstarch is suspended in the water as a starch and water mixture. A simplified explanation is: the  starch molecules are long chains of atoms. When you let them move slowly, they can slide past each  other. When you squeeze or hit them, they get tangled and cannot move. However, scientists are still investigating strange substances like Oobleck. There are still many questions  to answer! Red Cabbage Indicator   Safety As with all experiments, you should always get help from an adult. Some acids and bases can hurt your  skin, so you should wear: •Rubber gloves •An apron •Safety glasses (regular glasses, sunglasses or swimming goggles are okay if you don't have safety  glasses). If you get chemicals on your hands or gloves, do not touch your eyes! Wash your hands after completing  the experiment. What You Need •A red cabbage •A knife or grater •A medium sized bowl •At least 4 small cups •Chemicals to test such as lemon juice and baking powder or soda •coffee filter Step 1 •Have a parent, guardian, or teacher help you cut or grate between a quarter or a half of the cabbage into  small pieces. •Put the cabbage into a medium sized bowl. •Pour water over the cabbage. You can use cold water, warm or boiling water. Boiling water will work the  fastest, but only boil the water if you have an adult to help you. •Let the cabbage sit in the water for a while (30-45 minutes), until the water turns a deep purple colour.  You can stir the mixture to speed up the process. Step 2 •Using a coffee filter or a fine sieve, strain the juice into a cup. It should be deep bluish purple in colour. •Pour equal amounts of the strained liquid into small plastic cups. These are your 'test tubes' in which you will test different chemicals. Step 3 •Set one of your cups ('test tubes') aside. This is your control. It already contains water, which usually has  a pH of 7. This means that water is neither an acid nor a base. •Assemble some testing chemicals (some good ones to try are below). • Some Chemicals to Test •Lemon juice •Baking powder or soda •Milk •Yogurt •Vinegar •Soap •Label each cup with the name of the test chemical each cup will contain, so you will remember what you  put in each cup.J u m p t o n a v i g a t i o nJ u m p t o s e a r c h •Which chemical do you think is the most acidic? Step 4 •Pour, drip or spoon a small quantity of each test chemical into the cup labeled with its name. •Observe the change in colour of the juice. If the juice turns reddish, the chemical you are testing is an  acid. If the juice turns bluish, the chemical you are testing is a base. If it stays the same, the chemical is  neutral, like water. Observations •Arrange your cups from red, to pink, to violet, to purple, to blue, and to green. You might not have all of  these colors, but that's okay. •The cup that is most red is the most acidic. The cup that is the most blue or green is the most basic  (alkaline). Which chemical is the most acidic? Which is the most basic (alkaline)? Pinhole Cameras You will need these things: •A Long Box (The longer the box the bigger the picture will be) •A Pin or Needle •Some Glue •Some Tin Foil •A Ruler •A Pair of Scissors How to Make the Pinhole Camera Step 1: Cut a square hole in the top of the box on the smaller end that is about 1 inch  by 1 inch (2.5 by 2.5 cm) (use your ruler!) Step 2: Draw a line around the hole with some glue, then put a square of tinfoil on top so that the hole is  covered. Step 3: Once the glue is dried, poke a tiny hole in the tin foil with the pin. Step 4: Cut a hole on the long side of the box so that you can see the bottom of the inside of the box. How to Use the Pinhole Camera Next time you know there is going to be a solar eclipse, point your pinhole camera towards the sun. The  light will shine in through the pinhole and out onto the bottom of the box. Looking right at the sun can hurt  your eyes, so using a Pinhole Camera is a fun and safe way to watch eclipses. Raisin Dance What you need to do Step 1 Get a clear drinking glass (or beaker). Fill it with a bubbly and clear drink like Sprite or sparkling water. Step 2 Get raisins and add them slowly and keep putting them in the beaker. What Happens? The raisins rise up to the top, then fall down, and then rise to the top again. It's like they're dancing. The Science Bit The bubbly drink that you used is packed full of a gas called Carbon Dioxide (CO2). There's so much CO2  that it bubbles out of the drink. That's what makes it fizzy. When you drop the raisins in, some of the bubbles stick to the raisins. Since the bubbles are trying to rise  up out of the drink, they pull the raisins along for the ride. Once a raisin gets to the top, the bubbles come  out of the drink and pop. Since the raisin doesn't have bubbles holding it up anymore, it falls back down  where the process starts all over again. Don't forget to clean up! You can still eat the raisins and drink the soda. Bath Bomb A bath fizzer or bath-bomb is a mixture of perfume or scent mixed an alkaline and an which reacts in  water. Ingredients You will need: –Sodium Bicarbonate –Citric Acid –Scented powder, eg vanilla beans, cinnamon, lavender Look at the ingredients on baking powder: These usually just contain sodium bicarbonate which may be  written as NaHCO3  but may also contain lemon juice or citric acid (H8O7). These are the alkaline and acid you need. Citric acid is the main ingredient of fizzy lemon or orange drink crystals and bath salts. In  Europe, citric acid is often listed as as E330, sodium bicarbonate is E500. Some pharmacists stock boxes of pure crystalline sodium bicarbonate and refined citric acid crystals, but  these things are cheaper and more easily sourced simply by reading the labels on various powder  products sold in ordinary shops. The wanted product should be the main (ideally only) ingredient, but  expect to find colour, flavour and texture products mixed. Experiment The 'best' mixture will depend on the exact nature of the products you can find, but a good starting point is  an equal mixture of both ingredients, which we call 1:1 ratio of 50%. You may have try different mixtures:  1:1, 1:2, 1:3, until the most lively reaction occurs, particularly with baking powder, which often contains rice flour. Swirl the two dry powders together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball. The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a sort of shell. Don't do this if  you have cuts or grazes, because it can hurt. Once the ball has set, place it on a dry surface, wash your  hands thoroughly and dry them. Getting just the right moisture to make the ball 'set' will require a bit of trial and error! Now take some water that is as hot as is comfortable for a bath, drop the ball into it, and watch what  happens! Finally try adding some aromatic cooking powder such as dried lavender, vanilla or nutmeg, and some  food colouring. That's it! ","Oobleck is a non-Newtonian fluid that is sometimes a liquid and sometimes a solid. It is made by mixing cornstarch with water. To make Oobleck, you need about a cup of cornstarch and a cup and a half of water. Mix the cornstarch into the water until all the cornstarch is covered in water. If the mixture gets too dry, add a little more water.You can pick up Oobleck and squeeze it in your fist, and it will feel like a solid. When you open your hand and hold it over the bowl, the Oobleck becomes a liquid. You can also try floating a small object such as a plastic toy on the Oobleck.","['liquids', 'oobleck', 'fluids', 'chocolate', 'liquid']"
tania-costume-party-FKB-Stories.txt,"Tania's Costume Party Tania had just received an invitation. It was for her friend Karishma's birthday party. But this wasn't just any ordinary party. It was a costume party! Tania asked ""Mama, what is a costume party?""Mama replied ""You have to wear a costume to a costume party. You can dress up as a fictional character like Noddy. Or you can dress up as person belonging to a certain profession, like a doctor or a fireman. Or you can go as a fruit or vegetable like a banana, or as an animal like a cat. You can choose whatever you like, as long as you can make yourself look like it."" ""Oh! So what should I dress up as?"" ""You should think about what you want to go as. Let me know once you decide, and we will figure out how to make the costume together."" ""I can dress up as whatever I feel like?"" asked Tania. ""Yes. I will try my best to figure out a way to make the costume. You can help me. It will be fun.""The next day Tania was at the playground with her friends Tanisha and Sonali. They were discussing the costume party. Sonali said ""I am going to go as a doctor. My papa is a doctor, and I want to be a doctor when I grow up. Papa said I can carry a real stethoscope. He has an extra one. I promised to be very careful with it."" Tanisha said, ""My mama said I should go as a bookworm. I love o read, so she thinks it is a cute idea. She is making the costume for me.""Sonali asked ""Tania what are you going as?"" Tania said ""I have not decided yet. Mama said I can go as anything I like. I love animals, but I can't decide which one I want to go as. Eagles are so majestic, and they fly. So I feel like going as an eagle. But a lion is the king of the forest, and it belongs to the cat family like Kazoo. I can't decide between an eagle and a lion."" That night at dinner Tania told mama of her predicament. She asked mama what she thought would be a better idea: an eagle or a lion? Mama said ""I can help you with either costume, but you have to decide which one you want."" Tania kept oscillating between the two choices.Meanwhile, Tanisha's mother was making great progress with her costume. She made a worm by stuffing a sock with paper. She drew bespectacled eyes, a nose and a mouth with permanent markers. Spectacles are a must have accessory for a book worm. She attached the sock worm to a hair-band so Tanisha could wear it on her head. Tanisha showed it to Tania. Tanisha's mother was also stringing together a garland ofbooks, pamphlets and magazines for her to wear around her neck. Tania thought to herself, ""I better hurry up and decide what I want to go as."" The next day mama gave Tania a book about legendary mythical creatures. Mama hoped the book would help Tania decide what costume she should wear. Tania curiously opened the book and started reading. There were lovely pictures of dragons, mermaids, unicorns, griffins and sphinxes. There was also a brief description of each creature and some information about the origin of the myth. Tania was soon absorbed in the book. By dinner time she had finished reading it.At dinner, Tania said ""Mama, I know why you gave me the book. I know what costume I want to wear. I want to go as a griffin. That way I get to be an eagle and a lion at the same time. Is it a difficult costume to make?"" Mama grinned. ""You are very sharp Tania. We can make the costume. You can wear yourbrown corduroy pants and white t-shirt. We can make a lions tail with long strands of wool and hang it from the back belt loop of your pants. We can draw paws on chart paper and stick them with tape over your shoes. I can make you an eagle mask and some cardboard eagle wings. How does that sound?"" ""That sounds awesome mama. You are the best. I love you. Thank you for the book. I really liked it. I love animals, but these mythical creatures are really amazing. A griffin is so regal. Can we learn more about griffins tonight? I want to know more about what I am going as. The book also gave me lots of costume ideas for future parties. Next timeI can be a mermaid."" Having figured out what costume to wear, Tania skipped off to play with Kazoo. Mama groaned, ""Oh no! Maybe giving Tania that book wasn't one of my better ideas. Most of those costumes are a lot of work. I hope she doesn't get invited to too many costume parties.""","Tania is invited to a costume party and can't decide what to wear. She considers going as an eagle or a lion but eventually decides on a griffin after reading a book about mythical creatures. Her mother helps her make the costume, which includes a lion's tail, paws on her shoes, an eagle mask, and cardboard wings. Tania is excited to learn more about griffins and other mythical creatures and thinks about ideas for future costume parties. Tanisha goes as a bookworm, and Sonali goes as a doctor.","['costume', 'costumes', 'dress', 'tanisha', 'tania']"

At Last! PageThe Velveteen Rabbit How Toys Become Real Christmas Morning HERE  was  once  a  velveteen  rabbit,  and  in  the   beginning he was really splendid. He was fat and   bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted   brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and   his  ears  were  lined  with  pink  sateen.  On  Christmas  morning,   when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig   of holly between his paws, the effect was charming. There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a   toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but   the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy   loved him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there   was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels,   and  in  the  excitement  of  looking  at  all  the  new  presents  the   Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten.For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery   floor, and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally   shy,  and  being  only  made  of  velveteen,  some  of  the  more   expensive toys quite snubbed him.  The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down upon   every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended they   were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons   and lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never   missed  an  opportunity  of  referring  to  his  rigging  in  technical   terms.  The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't   know that real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed   with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was   quite  out-of-date  and  should  never  be  mentioned  in  modern   circles.  Even Timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was made by the   disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs   and pretended he was connected with Government. Between them   all  the  poor  little  Rabbit  was  made  to  feel  himself  very   insignificant and commonplace, and the  only person who was   kind to him at all was the Skin Horse.The Skin Horse Tells His Story The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the   others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and   showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had   been pulled out to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had   seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive  to boast and   swagger, and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away,   and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into   anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful,   and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced   like the Skin Horse understand all about it. ""What is REAL?"" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying   side by side near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the   room. ""Does it mean having things that buzz inside you and a   stick-out handle?"" ""Real isn't how you are made,"" said the Skin Horse. ""It's a thing that   happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not   just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."" ""Does it hurt?"" asked the Rabbit.""Sometimes,""  said  the  Skin  Horse,  for  he  was  always  truthful.   ""When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."" ""Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,"" he asked, ""or bit   by bit?"" ""It doesn't happen all at once,"" said the Skin Horse. ""You become. It   takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who   break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully   kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has   been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the   joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because   once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't   understand."" ""I suppose you are real?"" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he   had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive.   But the Skin Horse only smiled. ""The Boy's Uncle made me Real,"" he said. ""That was a great many   years ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It   lasts for always.""The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this   magic called Real happened to him. He longed to become Real, to   know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and   losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he   could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to   him. There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes   she took no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes,   for no reason whatever, she went swooping about like a great   wind and hustled them away in cupboards. She called this ""tidying   up,"" and the playthings all hated it, especially the tin ones. The   Rabbit didn't mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he   came down soft. One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the   china dog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry, and it   was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she   simply looked about her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door   stood open, she made a swoop. ""Here,"" she said, ""take your old Bunny! He'll do to sleep with you!""   And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the   Boy's arms.That night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in   the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy   hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and   sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit   could scarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight   hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks   with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy   used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the   bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived   in.  And  they  had  splendid  games  together,  in  whispers,  when   Nana  had  gone  away  to  her  supper  and  left  the  night-light   burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped off to   sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm   chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all   night long. And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy–so   happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was   getting shabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and   all the pink rubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him.Spring Time Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever   the  Boy  went  the  Rabbit  went  too.  He  had  rides  in  the   wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built   for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border. And   once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the   Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana   had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy   couldn't go to sleep unless he was there. He was wet through with   the dew and quite earthy from diving into the burrows the Boy   had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled as she   rubbed him off with a corner of her apron. ""You must have your old Bunny!"" she said. ""Fancy all that fuss for a   toy!"" The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands. ""Give me my Bunny!"" he said. ""You mustn't say that. He isn't a toy.   He's REAL!"" When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that   what the Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic   had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real.   The Boy himself had said it.That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love   stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his   boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a   look of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next   morning when she picked him up, and said, ""I declare if that old   Bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"" Summer Days That was a wonderful Summer! Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the   long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He   took the Velveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to   pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made   the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he   would be quite cosy, for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he   liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was   lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between   his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out   of the tall bracken near him. They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new.They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show   at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved;   one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and   bunchy, instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet   padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him,   twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which   side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump   generally have something to wind them up. But he couldn't see it.   They were evidently a new kind of rabbit altogether. They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the   time their noses twitched. ""Why don't you get up and play with us?"" one of them asked. ""I don't feel like it,"" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain   that he had no clockwork. ""Ho!"" said the furry rabbit. ""It's as easy as anything,"" And he gave a   big hop sideways and stood on his hind legs. ""I don't believe you can!"" he said. ""I can!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I can jump higher than anything!""   He meant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn't want to   say so.""Can you hop on your hind legs?"" asked the furry rabbit. That was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no   hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a   pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other   rabbits wouldn't notice. ""I don't want to!"" he said again. But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched   out his neck and looked. ""He  hasn't  got  any  hind  legs!""  he  called  out.  ""Fancy  a  rabbit   without any hind legs!"" And he began to laugh. ""I have!"" cried the little Rabbit. ""I have got hind legs! I am sitting   on them!"" ""Then stretch them out and show me, like this!"" said the wild   rabbit.  And  he  began  to  whirl  round  and  dance,  till  the  little   Rabbit got quite dizzy. ""I don't like dancing,"" he said. ""I'd rather sit still!"" But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly   feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the   world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did.The  strange  rabbit stopped  dancing, and  came  quite  close. He   came  so  close  this  time  that  his  long  whiskers  brushed  the   Velveteen Rabbit's ear, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly   and flattened his ears and jumped backwards. ""He doesn't smell right!"" he exclaimed. ""He isn't a rabbit at all! He   isn't real!"" ""I am Real!"" said the little Rabbit. ""I am Real! The Boy said so!"" And   he nearly began to cry. Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near   them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two   strange rabbits disappeared. ""Come back and play with me!"" called the little Rabbit. ""Oh, do   come back! I know  I am Real!"" But there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and   the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed.   The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone. ""Oh, dear!"" he thought. ""Why did they run away like that? Why   couldn't they stop and talk to me?""For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping   that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently   the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and   the Boy came and carried him home. Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but   the Boy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he   loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned   grey, and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape,   and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy.   To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little   Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people,   because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are   Real shabbiness doesn't matter. Anxious Times And then, one day, the Boy was ill. His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little   body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close.   Strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned   all night and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there,   hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for   he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him   away, and he knew that the Boy needed him.It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the   little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long.   But he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time   when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the   garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid   games  in  the  raspberry  thicket  like  they  used  to.  All  sorts  of   delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he   crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear. And   presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better. He was able to   sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit   cuddled close at his side. And one day, they let him get up and   dress. It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open.   They had carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a   shawl, and the little Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes,   thinking.The  Boy  was  going  to  the  seaside  to-morrow.  Everything  was   arranged,  and  now  it  only  remained  to  carry  out  the  doctor's   orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under   the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The   room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy   had played with in bed must be burnt. ""Hurrah!"" thought the little Rabbit. ""To-morrow we shall go to the   seaside!""  For  the  boy  had  often  talked  of  the  seaside,  and  he   wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny   crabs, and the sand castles. Just then Nana caught sight of him. ""How about his old Bunny?"" she asked. ""That? "" said the doctor. ""Why, it's a mass of scarlet fever germs!– Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn't   have that any more!"" And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture- books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the   garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a   bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He   had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next   morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot.That night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new   bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush   with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much   about it. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in   itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing   else. And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little   Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the   fowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied,   and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the   opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always   been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat   had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no   longer any protection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of   raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in   whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings.   He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden–how happy   they were–and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see   them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the   fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when   he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the   wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real.He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he   had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty   and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear,   trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground. The Fairy Flower And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen   a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all   like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the   colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a   golden cup. It was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry,   and just lay there watching it. And presently the blossom opened,   and out of it there stepped a fairy. She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was   of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck   and in her hair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of   all. And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in   her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp   from crying.""Little Rabbit,"" she said, ""don't you know who I am?"" The Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen   her face before, but he couldn't think where. ""I am the nursery magic Fairy,"" she said. ""I take care of all the   playthings that the children have loved. When they are old and   worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come   and take them away with me and turn them into Real."" ""Wasn't I Real before?"" asked the little Rabbit. ""You were Real to the Boy,"" the Fairy said, ""because he loved you.   Now you shall be Real to every one."" And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him   into the wood. It  was  light  now,  for  the  moon  had  risen.  All  the  forest  was   beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver.   In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced   with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the   Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at   her.""I've brought you a new playfellow,"" the Fairy said. ""You must be   very kind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit- land, for he is going to live with you for ever and ever!"" And she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the   grass. ""Run and play, little Rabbit!"" she said. But the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.   For when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he   suddenly remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want   them to see that he was made all in one piece. He did not know   that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him   altogether. And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to   move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he   thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it. And he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy   velveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by   themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the   grass. He gave one leap and the joy of usingthose hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf   on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did,   and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the   Fairy she had gone. He was a Real Rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits. At Last! At Last! Autumn passed and Winter, and in the Spring, when the days   grew warm and sunny, the Boy went out to play in the wood   behind the house. And while he was playing, two rabbits crept out   from the bracken and peeped at him. One of them was brown all   over, but the other had strange markings under his fur, as though   long ago he had been spotted, and the spots still showed through.   And about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was   something familiar, so that the Boy thought to himself: ""Why, he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had   scarlet fever!"" But he never knew that it really was his own Bunny, come back to   look at the child who had first helped him to be Real.THE END","The given text is an excerpt from The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams. It tells the story of a toy rabbit who longs to become real through the love of his owner, a young boy. In the excerpt, the Velveteen Rabbit meets two wild rabbits in the garden who mock him for not having hind legs.

The-Night-Before-FKB-Stories.txt,"It was one night ago (just the night before)   I heard someone outside knocking  on my door.   I looked  through the window and what  did I see... ?  A green scaly dragon looking  back at me !He had found me again, but how I can ’t say.  He always does  even though I run away.But I couldn ’t let him touch me, not one hair from my head,   so like any boy would ...Trembling  I crouched resembling live bait,   tortured  with fear regretting the wait.   Then suddenly I heard it-- the sound rang out true...  ... I hid under my bed ! ...Of the door crashing  down and the dragon  coming through !He checked several rooms. He could  have checked more ,but instead  he stopped outside my bedroom door.I could hear  his scales rubbing as the dragon passed through   and smelled  his breath stinking like a burnt rubber shoe.   He was close  and I knew it, but where could I go?...With the bed up above and the floor down below  ?I kept really still and I held my breath tight ,   wondering what my fate held that night.   He knew  that he had me, I just know  that he did,   as he checked all the places he thought  I had hid.He looked in the closet behind my old coats.He checked all my shelves and underneath my toy boats.He wouldn ’t stop looking and I quivered with dread,   as the dragon came close and stopped at my bed.  with the dragon so near?   Anticipating the moment his head would appear. Then something peeked under, but it was only his toe and the dragon sat down knowing  I was below.  What could I doIt was quiet for a moment, but that didn ’t last,   my bed started squeaking and shaking  really fast.I wondered what was happening, so I stuck out my head   and was surprised to see the dragon jumping on my bed.  He jumped up and down  ‘till it started to break.   Then sure enough, he  jumped with one final hard take.The mattress snapped in half when he landed on my bed. And he giggled  with delight as it landed on my head.I felt sure I was trapped when I first looked around,  crushed beneath my mattress and dust bunnies on the ground.   But no crying just yet, though I had no place to go.Instead of lying still, I wiggled to and fro.   I was finding more room and soon able to crawl,   the dragon never noticed ‘till he felt the mattress fall.  He was mad and I knew it, as he saw me run away, breathing purple smoke puffs in a vicious sort of way.   So I dashed  through the kitchen heading  for the door...   the dragon ’s hot breath getting hard to ignore.Just then I made it. I opened the door wide,   heading out doors leaving the dragon inside.   But since he thought he could make it, he let out a roar. Then the dragon charged forward crushing his nose in the door.I know I should have ran and found a new place to hide,  though the dragon started wailing loudly  as he cried.   But how could I run while holding my ears...or leave the poor dragon drowning in tears ?That ’s why I stopped, just to help the dragon out. I thought I could help and wrap his wounded snout.But did I get a “Thank-you! ” or did he say “How sweet! “ Or did he just stare at me like something good to eat ?Oh, he smiled at me as best as he could:   Like no respectable dragon  ever  should.With one hand, he reached out and touched me on my side.   With the other, he wiped the fake tears that he cried.The moment it happened, I threw the biggest  fit! I screamed myself hoarse when the dragon yelled...“TAG! NOW YOU’RE IT! ”"," a children's story about a boy who is visited by a green scaly dragon who chases him around his house.

Tale-in-Orange-R-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt," KOSTAS  STOFOROS           TALE IN ORANGE         Illustrations by   STEFANY VELDEMIRY     Translated from Greek by   METAXIA TZIMOULI                     to Styliana Galiniki    She saw a dream …                She was in an orange car …with her dad and mom. A strange music  was all around them. You could say it was purple …   With tales in red and yellow swimming i nside her, tears of joy ran  down her cheeks. When she wiped them, they had become orange …    “Where are we going? ” she asked her mom.   “On the Orange trip you wanted ”                  The path they followed connected the Orange State of the Moon with  the Purple Ni ght. It was made out of silk, knit by a bird that long before had  ran away from the seamstress of the palace ...      What a confusing dream! She could not understand it. Usually, she was  the one grownups could not understand. Everyone thought her love for   orange was bizarre. Obsession , they called it.   As a baby, her mom said, she got hold of an orange rattle and would not  let go. She only wore orange clothing. She ate only orange food.   She almost drove her parents crazy. They simply could not understand  her. But what else could she do?     Tiptoeing in the dark and quiet house, she went in the kitchen, opened  the refrigerator and looked at the shelves before pulling out a carrot.  Then she filled a glass of orange j uice and stepped out onto the b alcony.   An oran ge half -moon leaned into the sky’s background …Tomorrow  they were going on a trip .         The suitcases waited with patience in the hallway for dawn. Hers was  orange -what else?   For the first time in her life she would fly on a plane. For the first time  she wou ld be leaving the country. They were flying to Spain —her dad  showed her on the map and told her st ories about poets, painters and  bullfighters. They would rent a car (she picked it out herself on the  Internet and it was a fantastic and shiny orange Volkswa gen) and they  would go to magical cities, her mom said. Of course, they would also be going  to Portugal -or “Portokalia*” as she insisted on calling it.                                         * “Portokali” in Greek is orange. We ha ve the same word for orange color. So the name of the  country “Portokalia” is something like Orangeland. Also it reminds of Portugal (in Greek  “Portogalia”)        She believed this Lorca –mom’ s  favorite poet - with the most beautiful  gaze she had ever seen, was  definitely “Portokalian” . For who else could  write such a beautiful song about an orange tree ?    “Underneath the orange tree she washes the cottons   Green are her eyes and her voice purple ”    Why did her mother’s eyes cloud over when she heard the song, and why  did her dad always squeeze her hand?     Marianna drank her last drop, looked at the moon one more time and  went to sleep …   …I am going on a plane  to see the world from high above!                 Inside the airplane, Marianna could not stop gazing and asking  questions.  As the plane rose to the air, the earth grew smaller and smaller.  He pointed to a rock down below, “ Hump ” as they called it because of the  way it was shaped like a hump on top of the mountain. Under its shadow  people were diving from the rocks on ly to resurface from the ladder to do  it all over again …        Marianna found herself fascinated with the tray table that was popping  up and down. She was also fascinated with the orange juice, that the  stewardess had given her. She was really pretty and sp oke with a funny  accent, like her friend Jason. Then she gave her a toy -an airplane with  yellow and red colors: “the flag of Spain”, mom told her. If you mix red with  yellow you get orange!   “Spanish women are beautiful ”, said dad, looking at the stewardess . Her  mom blushed and did not say anything. Marianna played dumb. She did not  say anything either but she agreed with her dad!   She liked everything: even the unbelievable food. The paella was orange  and delicious. Maybe Spain is a part of Portokalia?  Somew here in Gibraltar  Hercules had discovered “ golden apples from the Garden of the  Hesperides ”, namely the oranges! Orange is her second favorite fruit – first  is tangerine .           She pulled out of her orange bag her coloring pencils and created her  drawing o f Porto kalia. A country that you could drink with a straw and it  would rain tangerines and oranges.  And the white boats that would take  off from her harbor and come back loaded with clams and sea urchins. They  had the smell of the sea when opened on the p late, an orange explosion …  Besides, everyone knows it: the more orange the eggs of a sea urchin  are, the tastier it will be!       But what is happening now? Her painting is alive!                 …The straw from the drawing grew. Marianna felt like it was sucking  her in  and all of a sudden she found herself flowing inside it like a waterslide …she  was scared but most of all she was having fun. She was flowing madly.  The  smell of tangerine became clearer as she got further down.  Like when she  would open with her f ingers a jar of her favorite tangerines from Chio and  the smell swam in her nostrils. Little drops splash you and you shiver with  delight …             She was flowing like Alice in Wonderland! She expected to see a white  rabbit run in front of her at any mom ent. But she was living her own  Fairytale -and without realizing it -she was in a sky full of tangerines. She  was flying on the tops of some strange orange trees and open books that  were flying too for the distant horizon …  She caught sight of some of the tit les: “Tangerine Jelly”, “Clockwork  Orange”, “Bitter Orange”, “My other half of orange”, “5/4 orange”,  “Tangerine Days” …  She swoops down next to a tower in the shape of a glass which  overlooks the cliffs of a foamed orange juice that runs down like the sea  and hits on the sandy beach .          She fell in too making a giant Splash! Her mouth was full of sweet and  sour juice …with quick strokes she reached the shore. In front of her a  road leads straight to the Orange Tower …  An orange carpet rolled out in front  of her feet. She hesitated.   “Come now, do not be afraid. We ‘ve been waiting for you! ”  An orange tiger, dressed in a green velvet suit, yellow boots with blue  dots and a huge red bow tie stood before her.   The tiger gently bowed down and showed her the wa y…  Marianna started walking on the carpet …      The orange tower               …Marianna hesitated a little and the tiger gently lead her by the hand  to the colorful entrance of the Orange  Tower …On top of the gate, one  giant and juicy orange slice sends out wa ves of its refreshing aroma.   Freshly squeezed orange juice in enormous jugs and glasses, foamed  around her. Small orange drops s prayed her as she crossed the entrance  into the hallway with the strangest paintings of oranges …She lost herself   in the design s and colors that she did not see the tiger disappear …  Still in a daze, she heard a sweet and melancholic song coming from the  sky:               “I open the closet and in the mirror I see a child smiling at me and telling me:   “I have been grounded. But if you w ant to keep coming over the glass is your door.   They cannot see me,   And when I say orange three times, come out”     Marianna looks up. A woman with a yellow blouse and blue skirt, holding  a big flower in her hand, sang …          She looked at Marianna when s he realized she was being watched and  said:  “Welcome. It’ s nice to see you here the first day of the month! ”  “But it’s not the first day of the month ”, answered Marianna …  “Here every day is the first day of the month! We have thousands of names  for the mon ths. We name them as we please. Do you have any idea what is  the name for today’s month? Let’s call it Marianna -isn’t that your name? I  do not think Lucia got it wrong. Who is Lucia you are wondering …the  stewardess! Oh, don’t look at me like that! Surprise d you, didn’t I? She  chooses who comes to Porto kalia. Do not think we welcome just anyone! ”  Marianna was dizzy. The woman kept flying over her head and not even  once did she stop to take a breath.             “Don’t be scared ”, she continued, unfazed, “ No one w ill notice that you  are missing! I, Isabella, named after the old Queen, am telling you. Have  you seen the play? Which play? The play: Isabella, three caravels and a  storyteller. It has some good songs as well. Have you heard the Oyster and  the pearl? My m om used to sing it to me so I could fall asleep …”  She started to sing, so sweetly, that Marianna forgot how dizzy she was.  She felt her feet leave the ground as she was climbing skyward in between  foaming oranges:    The young son from Tunezi,   Black like t he seabed’s oyster,   He who got caught in love’s net,   He had an eye, eye, eye,   He had an eye like  agate  He who got caught in love’s net,   That got caught in love’s net,     White, whiter than dawn,   Leonora, daughter from Castille,   Her skin a magnolia flower,   Her ear like a shell,   In love’s net she got caught as well,   In his love’s net she got caught as well,   The young son from Tunezi   Black like the seabed’s oyster,   Becomes pale whenever he sees her,              The oyster opens up, opens gently   Capturing her inside,   White, whiter than the dawn,   With trembling lips,   She kisses him sweetly.                  “I will not sing anymore ,” Isabella said, flying around her. “ It’s much too sad.  If I continue, I will not stop crying. And I see you were about to cry as  well. Your heart n eeds to be light in order for you to fly next to me. Come,  do not be afraid. Take my hand! Portokalia waits! ”     A strange writer                Isabella would not stop singing as Marianna held on to her hand in a  tight grip while they were flying over Portokalia . The houses did not have  roofs and Marianna could see what was going on inside. Children playing,  moms and dads cooking, some were reading and others were kissing. None  of them had television!   Marianna took an opportunity to ask about the roofs when Isabe lla  stopped her singing …  “Roofs, Roofs? Of course we have roofs for our homes! ”  “Why can’t I see them? ”     “We put them away when the sun comes out! Sunlight goes in and cleans  them. It’s like living in the country. When it rains we put the roofs back in.  It never snows here -the phrase “white as snow” we read in books, is  inconceivable here. Some folks let the rain in.  Instead of a floor they like  green grass in their rooms. They only cover the furniture when it rains.   This idea, the “portable roof” was di scovered by my great -great  grandfather, who was none other than the greatest inventor in Portokalia:  Juan Ramon Louis Bertrand! He was the first who made the towers out of  orange juice and no matter how much you drink it never finishes.  He  discovered the flying books that you can read while flying. The wallet with  the orange -money that never r uns out, also the machine that turns  kumquat seeds in jam in three minutes. The memory machine for names  that you forget, and the apricot ice cream with the almonds! And finally, the  orange dessert! Take a piece of paper and write down the recipe: It will  blow your mind! You don’t have a pencil? Watch me!  Pencil -paper, come!  ”     All of a sudden with great speed, right out of the sky, appeared some  paper with a perfe ctly sharpened pencil.   “Write !” Isabella said, and started reciting the recipe:         Ingredients   6 bottles of still orange juice   3 sachets of powdered cream   3 table spoons of sugar   1 ½ pack of Miranda biscuits   Optionally: almond or hazelnut threshed    Preparation   Heat the orange juice and stir with  powdered cream and sugar. Leave to  cool.  Spread in a clear pan a layer of biscuits.  Pour in half the cream. We spread  another layer of biscuits. We pour the  rest of the cream. Optionally, we may  put on top thres hed hazelnut or  almond. Leave in the refrigerator for  two-three hours.       The pencil was writing with great speed and perfect …grammar. As  soon as the recipe was written down, Isabella folded the paper and handed  it to Marianna.   “This is my mother’s reci pe. The pencil -paper that write on command, is my  great -great grandfather’s invention! He won Portokalia’s greatest award  for that: 3000 children’s smiles …Now look down! You’ll see one more of my  great -great grandfather’s inventions. A piano -typewriter! He  received the  Union Composers Aut hors of Portokalia  Award for it.   The truth is that he discovered it for a writer he felt unrequited love for - my great -great grandmother. He would send her presents and make her  promises, but she remained rigid.   Until the d ay he made the piano -typewriter.  She then realized that no one  would love her more. They lived together from then on, but she never  wrote on the piano -typewriter.  She told him that she did not want him to  think that she only married him for the magical p iano-typewriter. It was  enough for her that he made it, showing her his love …                …The piano -typewriter stayed in the sitting -room, unused -a sample of  their love. The first person who dared to touch it was Maria -Louisa  Korvalan -my mother and much loved  writer of children’s books of Portokalia.  There she is now!”            Marianna looked down and saw a woman with long hair and an  orange -yellow dress with letters on it.  Around her ten cups of tea and  coffee floated around her.    Isabella pulled out a maga zine clipping and read:   …”The writer, is a woman that words and stories live inside of her. When we  met her she was  wearing flowers for rings and blue heels. She said, with  those heels she would travel to the clouds whenever she got bored in  Portokalia. Sh e liked to drink dream coffees with a colorful friend. They  often do favors for one another. “Place me inside your book”, “Stick me in  one of your paintings!” They would go in fairytales together! She had a  piano -typewriter where she can listen to music of  her words when she  writes. It’s the well -known invention of Juan Ramon Louis Bertrand, her  grandfather, for whom she wrote the book: Juan the Orangeade... ”      Isabella stopped reading and cried out beneath her:   “Mom, look what is written in Portokalian News”.   The writer turned as Isabella made the clipping into a paper plane  and sent it down to her. “ Are you busy? May we come? ”   “Come! I am waiting for Soledad to paint together. What is your friend’s  name? ”  “This is Marianna from Greece ”, Isabella said.   “Oh Greece, it is such a magical country! We had gone with your father  before you were born. To the prettiest cave I have ever seen. With all  those colors …Oh hello Marianna. W ould you like some tangerine juice? I  brought the tangerine tree from an island that starts with the letter C,  four letters... ”  “From Chio ”, Marianna said. “ It has the most aromatic tangerines in the  world! ”        The writer, Maria -Louisa, went to the far end of the room -where they  had landed -and cut some tangerines from the tree that spread its  branches over the piano -type writer …Beautiful music was heard.   “That’ll be the doorbell! I’ll get it ”, Isabella said.    She came back holding hands with a woman that held in her other  hand a basket filled with carrots, paintbrushes, a bottle of r ed wine, and  various green salads …  “This is Soledad ”, said Isabella. “ I’d like you to meet Marianna from Greece ”.  “Greece! Oh the blue seas, the green, the orange trees, the unbelievable  light…”  She reached inside her pocket and took out a big painting wit h dolphins.   “Another of my great -great grandfather’s inventions: Pockets big enough  to fit paintings ”, whispered Isabella.      That’s how poetry  is written  in Portokalia                  Soledad pulled out of her pocket a painting and laid it in front of  Marianna a nd Isabella.   “It is a picture of me and Maria Louisa with our babies. We were sitting  underneath the oak tree that is swayed by the air, in between the most  fragrant flowers”, she turned to Isabella “so you could learn from a young  age beautiful scents ”.              “You were talking and singing …”  “And you fell in love with Fernando and we found you two hidden behind  the bitter oranges, kissing on the mouth!  ”   Isabella blushed and pulled on Marianna’s hand. Marianna didn’t have  time to say goodbye and before  she knew it they were flying up again.   “I have had it with hearing about Fernando!  ” said Isabella angrily and  Marianna thought for a second that she saw smoke coming out of her ears,  as they were flying with speed over a vast field with giant orange pump kins.         “Mr. Fernando wanted to see the world -alone. Portokalia was too plain for  him. He wanted to see how other people lived in other colors. He has been  away for months. And he has the nerve to send me postcards from  Eggplant (he talked our ear off a bout its wonderful capital, Lemovidio).  Letters from Greenistan and Trefoil. Carpets from White Isle, delights from  Sugaria …But I never reply! When he returns I shall give everything back.  Mr. Fernando never wanted us with him, you see... ”    Marianna could not get enough of the gorgeous orange landscape and  listening about all those strange countries she has never seen on any map.               Isabella slowly calms down and stays silent. And then a voice stretches  out along the plain. A voice that bring memorie s of crystal little bells,  running water that glistens in the sun, the sound of snow as it hit s the  ground softly, the fragrance of a tangerine as it is peeled open, a tender  but swift smile on a cloudy day …  Mom’s favorite song: “Underneath the orange tree , she washes the  cotton …” How strange! The song started forming into notes in the air as  they were flying over a forest with carrot trees and ora nge trees …             …and underneath the trees, a beautiful girl was actually washing her  cotton and singing …Hidde n behind a carrot tree, a young man was flying  around, collecting the notes with a net.     “He’s our National Poet, Diego Solomon ”, said Isabella with pride. “ He  wanders everywhere, collecting music and words and turning them into  lyrics”.           Then, Diego  Solomon turns to them smiling and starts reciting:       You washed the sheets down by the river   Dressed in orange, you were singing a song   About a thousand and two stars that dry on a string   While your slender fingers spread out the sheet     “What do you thin k?”  “Hmm …it needs a little more work, but you are off to a good start! ” said  Isabella .            She had a serious and erudite look on her face as if she  was herself was  a big book critic. Marianna could not believe that Isabella dared to speak to  the Nationa l Poet of Portokalia like that.   Diego Solomon took off, muttering to himself:   “They spread or they held the sheet? Sheet or handkerchief, yes I shall  write it like this: while your slender fingers held the handkerchief. Better!  ”  He turned and waved “ Thank you, Isabella! ’’  Marianna was stunned. Is that how they write poetry here?       Autumn?               When Diego Solomon was out of sight, Isabella told her about yet  another invention of her great -great grandfather’s, a gift to Diego  Solomon’s grandfather. P ablo Solomon was the great writer of Portokalia.  He used so many pseudo names that one did not know how many books he  actually wrote. His inspiration was endless and he lived almost half a  century writing non -stop. It has been said that if one was to colle ct all of  his writings they would be able to make a stairway leading to the stars!                  “With my great -great grandfather’s invention, Pablo sowed in the dirt  capital and small letters wherever he went and from that grew book  flowers, colorful ones, tha t would chase away the clouds and rain. In the  village of Portokalia, it was shiny with blue skies and plump white clouds,  whenever he would pass by.          Even now that he’s no longer with us, around his monument, which was  built with a huge orange, eve ry spring grow books with news stories that  always end in Autumn. One can only read them there. If you cut a book  flower, it withers immediately and the story is lost forever. Thousands of  people visit it in spring and summer … perhaps the next time you wil l  come …”  “The next time?”   “Now the leaves turn orange and brown, the wind that blows is calling  you back on your own journey. But always keep Portokalia in your heart”.     Marianna saw Isabella leave, disappointed …Luckily, she turned around  and hugged her ti ght just as her eyes were about to change into the color  of a clouded sky. Isabella whispered to her :     “You will always be in our hearts. Every time you eat an orange you will  think of me. And should you wish to come back one day all you have to do is  squeeze a tangerine and say the magic words:            “orange -tangerine  and a ripe lotus »          three  times and then clap your hands …”    Orange leaves and music started to encircle her in a swirling vortex.  Marianna could taste tangerine …swirling …her eyes were clo sing…           Her eyes open when she hears her mom’s voice:   “We’re here …look down! ”   Marianna was lost for a moment. Where was she? She looked down  and saw a beautiful city with a river …Nothing like Portokalia.   “Would you like some candy? ”   Lucia, the ste wardess smiled at her and winked.   “My friend Isabella’s favorite! It is orange and tangerine! ”   Marianna took a candy. As the taste flowed in her mouth, she began  to recover.   “Read what is written on the wrapper ”, Lucia said.            There they were! Diego S olomon’s corrected lyrics:     You were washing the sheets by the river   Dressed in orange, you sang a tune   About a thousand and two stars that were laid out to dry on the string   While your slim fingers were holding the handkerchief     “Have a great time ”, Lucia  said “ You’ll see that everything is as beautiful  here as it is in Porto kalia! ”             The plane touched the ground. A little later, her and her parents were  standing in front of the orange car of her dreams. Dad re nted it as a  surprise for her. The next several days she would learn that she did not  need to fly to live a magical and beautiful journey that is on the edge of  the world …  She would return to Porto kalia again to live extraordinary adventures.  But that is for another time, another journey! Ours e nds here!

Terrible-Tommy-Tom-Cat-FKB-Stories.txt,"Terrible Tommy-Tom Cat I remember when I was small and visiting Benny Badger's sett in Gingers Wood one morning. Gingers Wood was visited by a very unwelcome cat, who had a very awful urge to hunt the poor   mice of the Wood, but not to worry, all was well children, Benny helped to save the day again, and   this is how …  I was sitting in a small arm-chair, by a warm fire, in the dusty and small but comfortable sett,   watching Benny pouring some blackberry tea. I often borrowed books from his library of badger   history books in those days and was just about to ask if I could take a couple home with me that   evening, when suddenly Tyler rushed in from under the wooden front door.          “OH NO no no no no !”  He scurried quickly back and forth and spoke with a worrying panic until Benny asked :-          “What on earth is wrong Tyler ?”            “A CAT ! There's a cat, here in this wood.” He jumped up onto my lap and told us what had happened that morning :-           “Tommy Tumble Mouse and I were taking our morning             stroll through the wood when we were suddenly dived on,             he tried to catch us but we got away luckily,             we stood back and watched him put Tommy's             shoe that had been left behind inside his coat.”                   “But there where other items there, shoes, socks,                   jumpers, what he has collected over time,                   he is a mouse hunter, and he won't leave this wood                   until he has found every single mouse”.                 “It's alright Tyler, I will think of something,                    but in the meantime you wait here I am going                    to fetch the other mice, I will hide them in my                wheelbarrow under a sheet so they are not discovered”. Benny told him.                          “Be careful Benny,Tommy and I followed               him and watched him through our binoculars               from a distance”.            “He was sharpening his claws,               standing next to a boiling pot ready to cook with,               he was very frightening”. Benny then put on his little coat and headed out with his wheelbarrow,  he returned soon enough however. I had never seen so many mice in one room, if my mother had been there she would have been   terrified, how could anyone find them scary ? To me they where so friendly and sweet, there where   baby mice and mother mice, uncle and aunt mice, brother and sister mice, and Grandfather and   Grandmother mice with tiny reading glasses and walking sticks, telling their old tales of youth as   the little ones listened. Benny sat quietly trying to think of a way to frighten of the nasty cat. Suddenly the front door opened and Freddy Fox entered looking rather shocked, we later found out   that he had tried to ask the cat to leave but all he had got was a sharp and unfriendly ...                       Hhsssssssssst.           “I told him there were no mice hear but he said clearly              in his hissy slow voice …             You think you can fool me but you are wrong,             my sense of smell is far to strong.”            “He speaks in rhyme ?”   Benny asked and Freddy nodded nervously,             “he also said …             Tonight I shall be sat in a most comfortable seat,              to give myself a delicious treat,              a most delightful sort of meat,              after all, Stranger Fox I am at my happiest when I eat.” Benny then told me of the evil mouse hunters that went back generations, they would hunt all mice   and were taught to speak only in rhyme, it seems there are still these hunters around today using the   old rhyme, but Gingers Wood had never seen one until that day, Benny had to find a way to get rid   of him, and fast. After another 10 minutes or so, a sly scary knock came at the door and we all stood quiet until   suddenly a strange voice spoke,                                         “I know your hear I followed your scent,               and if you ask me it was time well spent.”             “What shall we do ?”   Tyler asked as the mice began to panic and shake with worry.               “I've got it”   Benny said happily                “Freddy come with me I have to see blossom bundle bumble bee.” They left through the back of the sett, as the mean cat tried to get in through the front.              “I've worked out a simple sum,                it will take 50 mice to fill my empty tum,                hand them over now and I won't get nasty,                I may even give you one of my special home made pasties.”   He said clawing the door.                “Now you may think I'm bad and sly,                  but I can't wait I won't tell a lie,                  to make myself a nice round pie.” His sharp claws where scratching at the wood, he was getting more and more desperate to get in.                  “What's that sound ? Too calm to be someone's tumble,                     it's more like a soft sort of rumble ?”  The front door opened quickly and 100 bees flew straight at him, I think it is safe to say I have   never seen a cat run as fast before or since, he ran out of the wood screeching loudly as the bee's all   flew fast behind him.                   “No mice,                     not for any rich price,                     your silly scare,                     was easy to bear,                     now it's our turn to scare and tease,                     have some moody bees,                     if you jolly well please.” Benny said, giving us all a cheerful laugh, as the mice danced around feeling relieved. Soon the day was over, the sun was setting and everyone began heading home, I borrowed some   books of Benny first of course, I remember in those days when I took the books home to my   parent's house my mother always wanted to know where I had got the strange Badger books that   were very small, dusty and delicate, I always said the same thing …               “From a friend Mother.” I could never tell her just who that friend was however, she never would have believed me …  The End            ","This is a story about a cat named Tommy who was hunting mice in Gingers Wood. Benny Badger, a kind and resourceful friend of the mice, helped to protect them from Tommy's hunt. When Tyler, a mouse, warned Benny of the cat's presence in the woods, Benny decided to hide all the mice in his wheelbarrow and brought them to his home. Freddy Fox also tried to help by asking the cat to leave, but the cat refused to go. Benny later found out that the cat was a member of a long line of mouse hunters who spoke only in rhyme. Benny eventually scared off the cat by getting 100 bees to chase him away. The story ends with everyone heading home safely, and the narrator borrows some books from Benny's library of badger history books.","['badger', 'tommy', 'cat', 'benny', 'tom']"
The-Friendly-Needle-Brandon-Green-FKB.txt,"Jack sat in the doctor’s waiting room. He squirmed in his chair but, no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn’t get comfy.It was vaccination day and it was Jack’s turn to get his jabs.He wanted nothing more than to run outside, race through the park, and settle in back home where it felt safe.His mother had promised him everything would be okay but poor Jack couldn’t shake off his worry. He looked across the waiting room and noticed babies snug in their prams, grandfathers wrapped up in their coats, and teenagers chatting to pass the time. Are they as worried as I am?  thought Jack to himself.He glanced at a noticeboard covered in posters. Something caught his eye.On a shiny blue poster was a drawing of a needle. It stood proudly with a friendly smile, hands on the hips of its barrel and a bright red cape floating behind it.Jack inched forward to take a closer look. “You nervous, kid?”  Jack jumped back into his seat. He shook his head in disbelief. It seemed as if the drawing had moved its mouth and asked a question.Suddenly, the needle climbed down from the blue poster and sat on the edge of the noticeboard, his legs swinging playfully back and forth.“I’m Needle Ned,” said the needle. “Jack,” he replied, still in shock .“Lovely to meet you, Jack!” Needle Ned said excitedly. “Now, something tells me you’re not looking forward to your vaccine.”  “Not one bit,” said Jack.“I understand.” Needle Ned nodded. “Lots of people feel that way, but I promise you, we needles just want to help!”Needle Ned pushed out his cape, flew over to Jack and sat gently on the seat next to him.“What part of it are you worried about, Jack?” asked Needle Ned. “I’m worried it’ll hurt,” sighed Jack.“You might feel a tiny pinch but that’s how you know we’re doing a good job!” Needle Ned smiled. “Our job is to protect you from all those nasty illnesses and viruses like COVID-19.”Jack imagined Needle Ned dressed as a knight, a huge silver shield in one hand and a glistening sword in the other, ready to fight off any monsters that came his way. A knight wouldn’t go into battle without armour, so would Jack say no to Needle Ned’s protection?“When you ride a bike, you wear a helmet,” said Ned. Jack thought about all the fun he had with his friends when they cycled in the park.“When you go outside, you wear shoes to keep your feet from getting muddy!”  Jack thought about how much he’d giggled while splashing in puddles with his friends. “When it snows, you wear gloves to keep your hands warm!”  Jack thought how proud he’d been when he had made an amazing snowman with his mother.“So we needles are no different! We are there to help, just like your helmet, shoes, and gloves – we protect you!” exclaimed Needle Ned. “Having a vaccine means you can carry on riding your bike, splashing in puddles, and building huge snowmen!” Jack realized Ned was right. It might hurt for a second, but afterwards, he could tackle even the biggest of monsters! With the help of Needle Ned, the doctor gave Jack his vaccine, and instead of focusing on whether he could feel a pinch, he thought about all the fun things he was going to do later that day.Needle Ned returned to his poster and waved to Jack as he left. “I’ll always protect you,” Needle Ned called after him.  Jack smiled. He felt as brave as a knight, knowing he was now covered against Covid-19!Jack learns that vaccines might not be as scary as he first thought","The story is about a boy named Jack who is nervous about getting his vaccination. He sees a poster of a needle with a friendly smile and it suddenly comes to life and introduces itself as Needle Ned. Needle Ned helps Jack understand that vaccines are important for protecting him against illnesses like COVID-19, just like how helmets, shoes, and gloves protect him in other situations. Jack realizes that getting vaccinated might hurt for a moment, but it is worth it to be able to do fun things like riding his bike, splashing in puddles, and building snowmen. With the help of Needle Ned, Jack feels brave and gets his vaccine without fear.","['vaccination', 'vaccine', 'needles', 'needle', 'vaccines']"
FKB-kids-stories-the-elephant-bird.txt,"Munia knew that the giant, one-feathered elephant bird had not swallowed the horse. Yes, he was big enough to swallow a horse, but that didn't mean he had! The village of Adhania had only one horse-cart pulled by the two horses Vayu and Drut. And Vayu had gone missing near the lake in the jungle where the bird lived.   The villagers had known about the elephant bird for generations.He was the last of his race, which was considered extinct for hundreds of years. The world did not know that the living  relic of that race, who had lost all his feathers but one, still roamed  the jungles of Adhania.   The bird and the villagers kept a safe distance from each other. But not Munia. Although she walked with a limp, she was brave of heart. She often slipped into the jungle to watch the elephant bird.The elephant bird came near the lake in the daytime to bask in the sun or play in the lake alone splashing water. Sometimes he sat half-submerged in water. At other times there was no trace of him.   Perhaps he just rested in some corner of the dense jungle. He stood as tall as a tree. He had a long strong neck, huge legs with claws and a heavy spear-like head. His long talons and nails looked scary.But Munia soon realised he was a shy herbivorous bird. He just munched on leaves by the lakeside.  Munia felt she had something in common with him. The elephant bird could not fly and Munia could not run! Other village children mocked her limp and did not include her in their games. That was why she liked staying alone.Every morning Munia helped fetch three pitchers of water from the village well, and collected wood so that Amma could light the stove. And then she would be out for a long time. Amma believed she went out to play with the kids. Little did she know that Munia went into the jungle to the lake where the elephant bird lived.One day, gathering courage, Munia stepped in the open near the lake. Without turning his head the elephant bird rolled his eyes towards Munia and then closed them, uninterested by her advance. Getting no more attention than the flies buzzing over his head, Munia stomped her feet. Suddenly the elephant bird lifted one of his claws. Munia cried and fell headlong into the shallow waters of the lake. She came out drenched to see him shaking all over. He was laughing!“That’s funny, huh?” she asked angrily and turned to leave. Before Munia had walked away from the clearing, something hit her feet. It was a fruit that the elephant bird had thrown at her. The elephant bird wanted to play! Hesitantly, Munia threw it at him. He trotted sideways and caught the fruit in his beak. Thus, Munia’s friendship with the elephant bird had begun. And just when she had finally found a friend, Vayu had gone missing! And everyone’s suspicion had turned towards the elephant bird.After searching for Vayu high and low, the villagers gathered under the old banyan tree. Everyone agreed that there could be no thief in Adhania. They all trusted one another. The milkman swore that he had seen Vayu gallop away towards the lake. “There is no sign of Vayu anywhere. It must be something in the jungle that got him,” a villager addressed the headman. “Who else can it be but the giant one-feathered elephant bird? He must be destroyed!” said the milkman. “For years he has been lying silent, hatching his evil plans!”The crowd agreed. Munia watched the proceedings quietly. She wanted to speak, but was scared of being punished for speaking up. Even if she spoke, who would believe her? “Yes, all these years of aimless living has made the giant dangerous,” said Munia’s father. “Today it is a horse, tomorrow it may be our children … ” The headman spoke over the villagers’ angry shouts, “Brothers, even though we are facing a giant, we have the strength of numbers. So let us go out and finish him!”A cheer of approval went up.  “The elephant bird did not eat the horse,” Munia said softly but firmly, limping forward. “I was with him when Vayu went missing!” A heavy silence fell on the gathering. “What does this mean?” roared the headman. “That the elephant bird is my friend, and he has not done this!”   “This girl has lost her mind!” shouted someone from the back. The other children laughed. “He only eats leaves! How can he eat Vayu?” Munia shouted, not moving from her place.“You can’t even plait your hair and you are giving us advice?” Munia’s father fumed and came towards her. “Go play with your friends!”   “This elephant bird is the only friend I have,” said Munia. Her father glared at her. But she didn’t cry and stood there facing the villagers.   “Forget about the girl, we will get the elephant bird in the morning,” said the headman and the gathering dispersed.Munia had only one night to prove the elephant bird’s innocence. “Think, Munia, think!” she whispered to herself. “The milkman saw Vayu gallop away on the road that goes to the lake. But the road takes a turn before it reaches the lake and goes towards Chandesara. What if Vayu had gone that way?”   Munia’s parents were angry with her and sent her to bed without speaking a word. Once they were asleep, she got out of bed, took the hanging lamp and stepped out of the house.She crossed Adhania, and came to the jungle path leading to Chandesara, the neighbouring village. Whoooo... rang the call of an owl in the jungle air. A jackal howled from a distance. The shadows of trees moved like long dark fingers. She hesitated for a moment but then thought of the elephant bird sleeping peacefully in the jungle. If she didn't do something to solve the mystery, the elephant bird may not be alive to see the next night. She took a deep breath and limped alone on the jungle path in the dead of the night.The next morning the villagers gathered near the lake with sticks, sharp stones and long kitchen knives. The elephant bird was resting when the crowd approached him. The sun shone on his featherless back. He got up slowly and stared at the crowd. Looking at his size, the villagers stopped at some distance. After a moment’s hesitation the headman cried, “Be ready!” The mob roared, firming the grip on the weapons, ready to run down the giant one-feathered elephant bird.“Stop!” Munia’s thin voice cut through the din. She limped between the mob and the giant.   “Munia! Come back at once!” her father ordered. “Grab her!” cried someone else.   Munia’s father and another villager rushed towards her. The elephant bird advanced a couple of steps and they stopped. “Okay …  if this is how you want it, we’ll tackle both of you together!” yelled a man, holding a spear.“What’s going on?” someone shouted from behind the crowd. A slightly hunched man with a long beard came in holding a horse’s reins.   The headman asked with a surprised look, “Saarthi, what are you doing here? And why is Vayu with you?”“Oh, as you know, I had sold Vayu to you some years back. Yesterday I was passing by your village early in the morning in my buggy pulled by Jhabru and Ghabru – Vayu’s brothers. I don’t know how Vayu got loose and followed us back to Chandesara! I couldn’t recognize him and didn’t know what to do with him until this morning when I saw this little girl going from hut to hut, asking about a lost horse. But what is going on?” he asked again.The villagers did not answer Saarthi. They hung their heads in shame. Munia’s father went to her, lifted her in his arms and took her back to the village. Since that day, no child laughed at Munia’s limp. They all wanted to be friends with her. And they all wanted to be friends with the elephant bird.   Munia’s tale reached many villages and the villagers in faraway hamlets whispered to each other, “Munia knew that the giant one-feathered elephant bird had not swallowed the horse!”This  story  is  inspired  by  the  real  Elephant  Bird (scientific  name:  Aepyornis  maximus),  the  biggest bird  that  walked  our  planet.  It  inhabited  the  island of  Madagascar.  With  more  and  more  settlements  on the  island,  and  more  forests  ruined,  the  species became  extinct  around  1700  CE.This is a Level 3 book for children who are ready to read on their own.

FKB-Kids-Stories-Tania-and-the-Blackout.txt,"The Blackout Tania was enjoying her after school snack. Mama was reading a book. All was quiet, except the sound of the fan. Suddenly the fan stopped working. There was plenty of sunlight coming through the large window. So, the fan was the only electrical appliance on, in the room. ""It is probably the fuse, but I wonder what tripped it"". Mama went to check the fuse box. The fuse box was fine. Mama opened the apartment door and saw the lifts had stopped working. ""Seems like there is a power outage."" Mama said as she closed the door. Tania had experienced the occasional power outage. It typically lasted for about a quarter of an hour and was usually maintenance related. But half an hour later, there was still no signof the power being restored. Baby Sonia had already woken up because of the heat. Mama picked her up and went down to find out what was going on. The lifts were working on emergency power. Many people were out trying to get information. Some were looking anxious, while others looked annoyed or upset. Mama found out that, a worker at a near by construction project, had accidentally damaged a few power cables. So the power would not be restored till the next morning. There was going to be a blackout for the entire area.Mama returned to give Tania the bad news. Tania was worried but also excited. ""No electricity all night! What will happen? Has that ever happened before?"", asked Tania in awe. ""When we were kids, power outages like this, were common."" Mama said, laughing. ""Really?"" Tania asked wide-eyed. ""What did you do?  You can't read or play board games in the dark. You can't watch TV. The laptop and cell phones may work for sometime on battery, but you did not have those when you were kids. What about the fridge? Will the food all go bad?"" ""Actually you can read or play board games in candle light. We also told each other ghost stories, because they sound so much scarier in the dark. Wait.. I just thought of something, that is great fun to do during blackouts"" ""What is that?"" asked Tania intrigued.Mama rummaged through one of the storage cupboards and pulled out a very old book, that belonged to grandpa. It was about hand shadow puppets. She showed it to Tania. With the sunlight streaming in, Tania could read the book. She was fascinated by the number and variety hand shadow animals that could be made. Tania got a torch and drew the curtains. Then mama and Tania tried out a few of them together.The bird was easy, but the elephant was more difficult. It was great fun getting such realistic representations of the animals with shadows of the hand.Mama showed Tania how she could make the elephant big by keeping the torch close to her hands and the bird small by keeping the torch far from her hands. Suddenly, Tania had an idea. She shared her idea with mama. Mama thought it was brilliant and agreed to help. Tania gathered together all the members of her reading club  The Bookworm Babies  in the clubhouse. The clubhouse had large windows andthe last couple of hours of daylight poured in. Tanisha, Karishma, Sonali, Rajiv, Nikhil and Vivek were, curious to find out, what Tania was up to. Tania showed them the book about the shadow animals. ""I think we should do a shadow puppet show. We can make up a story with animals from this book and then do a show for the entire society."" Tania said beaming with excitement. Before anyone could respond, she continued ""Mama is setting it up with the society chairman. The watchmen will go and inform everyone about it. Mrs. Desai, from the first floor, has agreed to hang a large white sheet from her balcony. The watchman will nail it to the walls of the garage below to make a screen. We can use a torch and stand behind the screen to make the shadow puppets. So what do you think?"" To Tania's relief, all her friends responded with enthusiasm. What a great way to spend a blackout! They leafed through the pages to make a list of possible animal characters. It did not take them long, to come up with a simple story. Each kid chose to play one or two of the shadow animals. They worked on perfecting their chosen shadow animals and the voices for them. Tanisha was going to be the narrator so she worked onimproving the script of the story. Once the light faded they all went home to have dinner. The show was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. At 8:00 p.m.  The Bookworm Babies , all gathered in the garage behind the screen. They had 4 powerful torches with them. Mama was helping the watchman set up the mats and chairs for the audience. There were no street lights or glowing signs in any of the neighbouring areas. So it was pitch dark. Tania spent a few moments admiring the gorgeous night sky in the absence of the usual light pollution. Soon the chairs and mats were full. Tanisha announced, that the show was about to start. There was applause followed by silence. Tanisha introduced herself as the narrator and explained that all the characters would be shadow animals appearing on the white sheet screen. Tanisha as Narrator:  Elle the elephant is out on her morning walk. Tania made the elephant shadow puppet move along the screen.Narrator:  It is an uncomfortably hot summer morning. After 5 minutes of  determined walking at a brisk pace, sweating and panting, Elle switches to a  stroll. She is very thirsty. So she walks over to the forest pond. Tania playing the role of Elle:  Oh my goodness! The pond is more  than half empty. There was a lot more water, when I was here yesterday morning. Narrator: Oh look the bunny twins Bob and Bobette are here.(Bunnies Bob and Bobette appear on the screen alongside Elle) Elle:  The water is getting depleted much faster than usual, isn't it? What do you think Bob and Bobette? Karishma playing Bobette the bunny:  Yes. It is so hot. We need to drink twice as much as usual. Nikhil playing her brother Bob:  And because the sun is so strong, the water is evaporating faster too.Bob and Bobette bobbed their heads up and down in agreement and then scooted off.  Tania brought Elle back on screen. Narrator:   Elle looks worried. A water shortage would be a  disaster. All the animals would fight for water. Hey, look, it is Bubbles the blue jay. She has come for a sip of water. Sonali playing Bubbles in a chirpy voice:  What's up Elle? Why do you look so glum?Elle:  I am worried about the water situation. Bubbles: Yes that is worrisome. Some of the trees are drying up too. Elle:  May be us herbivores should eat more fruits like water melons, so we need less of the water from the pond Narrator:  Now Pemberly the pig is here. Lets see what he has to say about this issue. Rajiv playing Pemberley:  That's not a solution any more pal. The  monkeys have already polishedoff most of the melons, over the last few  days. May be it will rain soon. That is our only hope. Narrator:  Scruff the mutt just arrived. He looks tired. It is quite a long run from the nearest town, where Scruff is a stray. But this lovable mutt has lots of friends everywhere. How could he not? Look how cute he is. Vivek playing Scruff:  Not much hope of that, Pemby. I just heard the weather forecast on the radio. They  said that, the rains are going to be even later than  usual. The humans seem worried too. I heard a couple of the village eldersdiscussing water rations for each house. Pemberly:   (Produces a magnificent snort of disdain)  Those humans use too  much water. They should have water rations everyday. Anyway, it's because of them,  that we are in trouble. We can't get to the river, because their town is in the  way. They make it too dangerous, for us to get water from the river. Elle:   (Nods in agreement)  They set traps for us and hunt us too. Such  uncivilized barbarians! Narrator:  Geegu the goose has startled everyone with her dramatic entrance. She swooped in, took a sip and flew out all in one continuous, graceful motion. Now, much to Elle's annoyance, she has parked herself on Elle's broad back. (giggles)Sonali playing Geegu:  I have been listening to you for a while from that tree there. You are pretty loud, you know, when you complain. And a fine lot you are! What good is complaining about those  humans going to do? Do you have any solutions? Narrator:  Elle and Pemberly are turning pink. They obviously don't have any solutions to offer. Geegu:  I have a far-fetched idea. It probably wont work, but it is worth a try.Everyone except Geegu together:  What is it? Geegu:  These humans are not all bad you know. They can be smart, sometimes. Many years  ago they lived in the forest. In those caves towards the west. Scruff:   (In an awestruck voice)  They did? No way! Geegu:  Yes they did. At that time, they figured out a dance. They believed, if 6 of them got together in a circle and did the dance, it would rain. I don't know if it works, but I know the dance. They made pictures on the walls in the caves, that tell you how to do it. Elle:  So, what is the problem? Just do the dance and see if it rains. Geegu:  I think, it would have to be 6 heavier animals. We geese are too light. Narrator:  Donald the deer is passing by, and wait, it looks like he has heard Geegu. He is going to join in the conversation.Donald played by Nikhil:  Geegu, I just heard what you were saying. My herd has half a dozen deer and we love to dance. We can give it a try. It is a worthy cause. Narrator:  Geegu spent the afternoon teaching the deer the dance. By late afternoon, they finally understood all the complicated steps. Some of them were difficult for 4 legged animals but Donald's herd was talented. Look they are ready to start their performance right next to the pond. Six dancing deer played by Tania, Tanisha,Vivek, Nikhil, Sonali and Rajiv appear on the screen along with Bobette played by Karishma for about a minute Narrator:  All the animals have come to watch. Bobette is beating two stones together to make a rhythmic sound that Geegu says is an  essential part of the process. (Abhijeet helped out by making loud rhythmic sounds by beating together 2 cricket bats.) Narrator:  What a beautiful dance. But it is almost over. Will it work? I sure hope it does. (Abhijeet startled everyone by emitting a fairly realistic thunder like sound.) Narrator: Yikes was that thunder? Oh yes it is raining. The dance worked. Oh wait now ! That is funny. It is raining only for a little distance around where the dance was done. The animals have never seen anything like it. They are amazed and thrilled. Now they will have enough water for the rest of the summer. All the animals celebrate together shouting Horray and Yay and the shadow animals are all seen running around on the screen for a few seconds.Elle:  May be these humans are not so  bad after all. At least those old tribes developed some smart  tricks. Scruff:  Yes. But I don't think the modern humans would believe this. Bobette:  Don't tell them. It will be our secret, to get through draughts.  Those humans use more than enough water, as it is. Narrator:  That's the show. Hope you enjoyed it. (All the shadow puppets took a little bow on screen and then the Bookworm Babies and Abhijeet came and took a bow in front of the screen.) There was great applause from the audience. What an ingenious idea for  a blackout. Papa came back stage and gave Tania big hug. He told her, that he was very proud of her for coming up with the idea.

eureka-R-FKB-Stories.txt,"Eureka!It was a lovely sunny morning inSeptember. Ganesh Chaturthi meant it wasa holiday from school. Tania and herfriends were at Karishma's housecelebrating the festival of the elephantheaded God Ganesh.There was an idol of Ganesh decoratedwith flowers and surrounded by lamps.Karishma's mother was distributingmodaks. Modaks are dumplings made ofrice flour stuffed with jaggery andgrated coconut. They are supposed to beGanesh's favourite food and was Tania'sfavourite part of the celebration.Karishma's mother also served puranpolisand some other Maharashtrian delicacies. Replete with tasty wholesome food,Tania, Tanisha, Sonali, Rajiv and Nikhildecided to go outside and play to makethe most of a rare sunny day in themidst of the Bombay monsoon.4Tanisha announced that her sister Trishahad taught her a new game called 'TheQueen of Sheba'. She said, ""One of ushas to be the queen of Sheba and askeveryone to get something from thesurroundings and the person bringing thebest sample wins."" Tapping her wristwatch she added, ""Of course there is atime limit. ""5""Sounds like fun"", said Nikhil. ""Tanishasince the game was your idea you shouldbe queen.""Tania, Sonali and Rajiv agreed. Tanishawas thrilled. She said ""Let us do atrial round so I can explain better.""Then in her most haughty voice, ""Thequeen of Sheba wants a feather. Theperson bringing the longest featherwins. You have 1 and a half minutes.Your time starts now.""Tania, Sonali, Nikhil and Rajiv shot offin different directions in search offeathers. Nikhil was the first to return6with a feather closely followed bySonali and then Tania. Rajiv arrivedlast just as the time was up but he wasempty handed. Poor Rajiv had not found asingle feather. Nikhil, Sonali and Tania placed theirfeathers next to each other to comparetheir lengths. Sonali's was the longestso she won. With a clearer idea of thegame they all waited eagerly for thenext round. The next time Tanisha askedthem to get individual blades of grassand the one getting the largest numberof individual blades would win.7Nikhil, who managed to get 33 blades wonthis round. The game was quiteenjoyable. Tanisha was inventive withher orders and fair in her judgementsand made a great queen, until ....It was round 5 and Tanisha had asked fora rock and said the person bringing thebiggest rock would win. The rocks Sonaliand Nikhil brought were clearly smallerthan the other two. But Tanisha simplycould not tell whether the rock Taniahad brought was bigger or smaller thanthe one Rajiv had brought. They had very8different shapes and it was verydifficult to compare. Tania and Rajiv started fighting andTanisha looked really harassed. ThenTanisha spotted Tania's papa sitting ona bench nearby reading a book. She saidloudly so that she could be heard overthe din, ""Okay, stop! I see Tania's papathere. We should ask him. He may knowhow to decide which one is bigger.""Every one agreed this was a good idea.They all approached Tania's papa.Tanisha explained their problem and9asked if he could help.Papa nodded and said ""Over 2000 yearsago the king of Syracuse had a similarproblem. The king had given a goldsmitha block of pure gold to make a crown forhim. The goldsmith though talented wasalso known to be dishonest. He presentedthe king with a beautifully craftedcrown. "" ""But the king suspected that thegoldsmith had substituted some of thepure gold with silver and kept the goldfor himself. The king wanted to know ifhe had been duped. Desperate to know thetruth, the king approached the scientistArchimedes. Archimedes promised to do10his best."" ""Archimedes knew that if a gold andsilver bar are of the same weight thesilver one is bigger because silver islighter. So if silver was mixed in thenthe crown would be bigger than a blockof pure gold of the same weight as thecrown.""11""So the problem was to figure out if thecrown was bigger than a block of gold ofthe same weight or not. It was so hardto tell because of the funny shape ofthe crown . So the problem wasessentially the same as the one youhave.""""So then what did Archimedes do papa?""asked Tania. ""Did he figure it out?""""Patience, Tania. I am coming to that.Archimedes was still thinking about theproblem when he went for a bath. The12water level in the bath tub went up whenArchimedes stepped in. That triggered anidea and Archimedes got so excited thathe ran out of the bathroom, forgettingeven his clothes, shouting eureka!eureka!"" ""What is eureka?"" interrupted Rajivpuzzled.""Eureka is the Greek word for 'I gotit!'"", said papa.13""So he did figure it out then. But how?I don't understand."" said Tania.""Okay let me explain with an example.Suppose you have a glass with a littlewater in it. You mark the water level."" ""Now say you put a lemon in that glass.Then what happens?""14""The water level goes up, just like inthe story of the thirsty crow"" saidTania.Papa prompted ""The bigger the lemon...""""The higher the water level rises""finished Nikhil.""So now you can imagine what Archimedes15did. He took a glass container andfilled it with some water and marked thewater level. Then he put the block ofpure gold of the same weight as thecrown in and marked the new water level.Next he replaced the block with thecrown. The water level rose higher thanit had for the gold block. That meantthat the crown was bigger than the goldblock. So it was not made of pure gold."" Then papa turned to Tanisha and said,""So now do you know how to solve yourproblem queen of Sheba?""16""Yes!"" exclaimed Tanisha. ""Look Rajiv,your brother is washing his newmotorbike there. We can ask him to lendus the bucket."" The kids filled the bucket with somewater and marked the water level. Thenthey put Tania's rock in and marked thenew level. Next they replaced Tania'srock with Rajiv's rock. This time thewater level rose higher than it did forTania's rock. That meant Rajiv's rockwas bigger making him the winner.That evening, at dinner, Tania lookedvery thoughtful. She asked, ""Papa wecould not have used that idea to compare17the size of two objects if one of themfloated right, like a piece of wood Imean?""I am really impressed you thought ofthat. It is good to know the limitationsof any scientific method. But it is alsoimportant to see if you can come up witha simple work-around. Can you think of away to work around that problem Tania?""Tania thought for a moment and said ""Youcould push the wooden piece in so it issubmerged in the water"". She soundedvery sceptical that the solution couldbe that simple.To her surprise papa said ""That iscorrect Tania, but you need to push itjust a little below the surface so yourfinger does not get submerged toopushing the water further up.""18""The real problem would be to comparethe size of 2 things if one of them wasspongy like a sponge or a pillow. Thenthe sponge would soak up the water andthe water level would not rise much. Inthat case you would have to look for adifferent solution.""Papa added ""Tania I think this was agreat way to celebrate GaneshChaturthi.""""What do you mean?"" asked Tania puzzled.""Well Ganesh doesn't only eat modaks youknow. He is also a patron of arts andsciences and the God of intellect andwisdom."" said Papa grinning.19","The story is about Tania and her friends celebrating the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi at Karishma's house.

Hi, I like to stop sentences so people can breath after reading something. For example ...I went to the store to get milk but there was no milk so i had to wait for them to restock so i went to go to pay . This sentence is every long and you  never get to take a break to breathe. Here is the same sentence with with full stops .I went to the store to get milk but there was no milk . I had to wait for them to restock. So I went to go pay .See that's so much better. There's one rule you have to follow always end a sentence with a full stop. Well I have to go get some milk .Nice meeting you FULL STOP.        “Here is our kitchen, we love to make pancakes here. Speaking about pancakes there is exclamation mark making pancakes. Lets go talk to him next.  Hello, I heard you were learning about punctuation, that's cool!!!!! Can I teach you about what exclamation marks are?

I'm pretty easy to use there is not many rules, just put me at the end of a question, that’s all. “Lunch is readyyyy” said comma, “Coming,” said  Jordan. Let's go get some lunch.  Hi I’m comma. Fullstop said you were learning about punctuation. Well you use commas to separate ideas ,especially when they are joined by any of these seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet, eg: The game was over, but the crowd refused to leave.   “Hi Jordan,” Jordans friend was quotation mark, “nice to meet you, can we tell you the importance of quotation marks?’”  Two are used to show that someone is talking, for example: “We need to go to the store.” said Emily. “I think is is a good idea.” replied Jordan, so they went to the store . We don't know who is talking or if it is someone talking and not the narrator if we don’t use quotation marks . Well, I think it is time for you to go home, it is getting late, I hope you learned a lot about punctuation.I’ll see you again soon! ","The text is a playful and creative introduction to the concept of punctuation, with different punctuation marks personified as characters in the narrator's house. Full stop (or Period) explains the importance of using periods to break up long sentences, while exclamation mark emphasizes how exclamation marks add excitement and emphasis to statements. Question mark teaches about using question marks to indicate questions, and comma explains how commas are used to separate ideas. Quotation marks are also briefly mentioned as a way to indicate dialogue. The text ends with a farewell from the narrator, Jordan, encouraging the reader to continue learning about punctuation.","['punctuation', 'stops', 'sentences', 'milk', 'break']"

A_slice_of_cake-FKB.txt,"All About us!   A mother, teacher, and an educational consultant, Nebras Hassan began writing A Slice of Cake as a response to the events that took place annually in schools, celebrating International Day. Nebras Hassan was nominated in the Al Ain Times as the Teacher Feature of the year in 2007. She was described by her students as being “fun and exciting especially when she reads stories”.   Determined to share her enthusiasm for reading with young children she began writing. She uses her skills and experiences to combine all the educational elements in an engaging way to young readers. Nebras shares these skills with teachers when she delivers workshops on reading. Growing up in London then getting married in Manchester and finally moving to the UAE, Nebras’s circle of friends are multicultural and represent all the flavours of the world. She wanted to reflect this in her book, A Slice of Cake, which emphasizes the importance of sharing and being tolerant with one another, regardless of culture, colour, or religion.   Terry loves drawing, painting and telling silly stories, he met Nebras in the United Arab Emirates where they were both teaching and it wasn’t long before they were plotting a children’s novel. They had fun deciding how the characters would look and how best to share this lovely story. Terry was delighted to be given the opportunity to be involved in such a super project, that was all about sharing and cooperation no matter where we live, who we are, and what we believe.  It is Snozz's birthday. He rushed to his mum to see if   she had baked a cake.  “Have you made my birthday cake?”  Mum looked very sad and explained,  “I have run out of flour and eggs.”  Snozz knew that you can't make a cake without flour and   eggs.   “Don’t worry. Let's go to Earth and borrow some flour   and eggs.” said Mum.   Snozz and Mum got into their spaceship and fastened  their seat belts.   “ YIPPEE!” yelled Snozz as the spaceship took off.   Very soon they saw themselves hanging off the Statue  Of Liberty in the United States of America.   “Oh dear! I never get my parking right!” said Mum.    “It's a good job I've packed the parachutes.” she   reassured Snozz.                Walking to the nearest house they knocked on the door.  As the door opened a lovely smell rushed out and there  stood a lady wearing an apron.  “Oh hi di!”  Said the lady. “Can I help you?”  “We have come to borrow some flour and eggs. I am  going to bake my son a birthday cake,” Mum explained.  “Oh, I am very sorry, I have just used the last of the  flour and eggs to bake a cake. You can have a slice of my   cake,” she offered.  Mum and Snozz thanked her for the cake and headed  back to the Spaceship.  “Don’t worry Snozz, we will go next door to Peru. I've  heard it is a beautiful country. We will surely find flour  and eggs there,” said Mum.  Soon they landed in a city called Machu Picchu.  “Do you know it's built on a mountain?” Mum asked.

The spaceship landed on Ayers Rock which is the world’s   largest rock.  Walking down the road they came upon an Aboriginal   woman.  “Kaya,” said the lady, “How can I help you?”  “We have come to borrow some flour and eggs. I am   going to bake my son a birthday cake.” Mum answered.  The Aboriginal woman explained that she had just used   the last of the flour and eggs to bake a cake.   “You can have a piece of my cake,” she offered.

I-Can-Paint_FKB.txt,"Why is phonics important to learn?  The English language seems like it is full of a lot of crazy pronunciations and spelling. While a small amount of English  must be rote learned due to exceptions from rules, much of it can be decoded using phonics. When you know phonics,  you are like a detective following clues to solve a mystery. In this series, we use only words that your little reader will be  able to break down into standard phonemes. This will build reading conﬁdence while strengthening their phonics  foundation.   Is this the right level for my little reader?   If your reader can decode about 90% of the words in this book independently, this will be an appropriate platform to begin  their study of phonics. By understanding a majority of the words, a reader can use context to decode new terms. If a reader  breezes through, you might need to take them up another level. If this level is still a bit too tricky for them, get your reader to  try some of the earlier levels ﬁrst. Challenges can be good, but too much too quickly could overwhelm your reader. Take  things slow and steady. Enjoy the books and the journey together!  How can I be a good learning buddy for my reader?   If you are helping somebody to read this book, there are plenty of ways that you can go about it. Do the initial exercises  together before you begin to read so that you have both experienced the isolated sounds and discussed them. If the reader  gets stuck, cover up all but the ﬁrst phoneme in the word so that the sound can be isolated again. Slowly move along and  reveal more phonemes. Once they can say each individual part of the word, you can focus on blending. Say the words so  that they can hear them, and get them to repeat it out aloud several times. To consolidate knowledge after you ﬁnish a  page, talk about what happened and what is in the picture. Then, try saying some of the words on the page and see if  the reader can identify them. Get the reader doing this as well, saying words which you need to ﬁnd. Above all, you  should be patient. Create a safe place to make mistakes so that the reader is willing to give things a go.I can paint! I can paint a train.A train in rain. A train in Spain!I can paint!

Ballu was big, brown and strong.  On his fourth birthday, Avanti organised a little party for Ballu.“Ballu, can you blow out all the candles at once?” Avanti asked. “Of course!” said Ballu. He filled his chest with air. He huffed and puffed and puffed and huffed and went “WHOOSH!”The blast of air blew the candles out. Then rising up, it crashed into the clouds in the sky. And all of a sudden, there was was a roar of thunder and it started to rain.“Hey, it’s raining fish,” Avanti shouted. Ballu looked around with wonder. Then he picked up a huge basket and ran around collecting fish as they fell from the sky. Every time the basket filled, he dropped the fish in a little pond and ran back for more.Then, as he was rushing for the tenth time to the pond, he turned back. The water level had risen and he could see that Avanti was scared.Ballu came back quickly, picked Avanti up and placed her on his shoulders.  Avanti put her arms around Ballu's neck and thanked him. Soon, the clouds disappeared and the sun came out. It was bright and cheerful once again.“I will never again ask you to blow the candles out,” said Avanti. “Why?”asked Ballu. “Who knows? Next time it might start raining frogs,” Avanti said and the two friends started laughing.#6FrameStoryChallenge: A Carnival of Art The illustrations in this book were created as part of the #6FrameStoryChallenge, an online campaign run by Pratham Books to build a rich bank of illustrations for StoryWeaver. The essence of the #6FrameStoryChallenge was to tell a good story using just 6 illustrations.  The campaign inspired nearly 70 illustrators to donate their time and skills to India’s first open-source story-publishing platform for children. What started out as an experimental campaign soon blossomed into a carnival of art, birthing nearly 500 new illustrations. These wordless narratives cut across language barriers, opening up a world of possibilities, encouraging StoryWeaver’s growing community to dream up multiple stories around these images.

The-Witches-Daughter-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt,"INNER COVEROnce upon a time, there lived a witch who was very mean and ugly . She was as ugly as a burnt plum pudding. She had only one daughter , who was named Broccolina, and she was no nicer than her mother . The witch wanted to train her daughter in witch-craft, to follow in her footsteps. But, no matter how much the mother tried, Broccolina was not the least bit interested. She never wanted to be bothered with witchcraft or housework, either . She was only interested in becoming beautiful. Broccolina was very worried about her ugly looks and she spent most of her time in front of the mirror , putting on make-up. She painted her face in colors and polished her claw-like nails until they shone. She did her hair up, every morning, evening and night, in every style she could think of. She wanted to look as pretty as possible, but she never realized that all she did only made her look worse. 3The Witch’ s DaughterOne day , her mother had to go on a journey to a far -off land. She ordered Broccolina to keep stirring a magic potion, which was on the fire, until she returned. “Why should I have to do it?” Broccolina complained. “You know how much I hate to stir potions. The big spoon spoils my nail polish, and the steam makes my make-up run.” “It has to be done!” said her mother , heading out the door . “I’ll be back as soon as I can. In the meantime, keep stirring that pot!” “It’s not fair!” Broccolina muttered. She picked up the big spoon and started to stir .After a while, she heard an unfamiliar sound. It was like a swarm of bees droning, overhead. She looked up to see what it was.  “Oh!” she cried. It was a lovely angel, flying above her . Broccolina’ s eyes widened at the sight.  “What a beautiful creature! If I could just be as beautiful as that!” she said to herself enviously , gazing at the angel.“How did she become so beautiful? There may be some secret to it,” she thought. “If I could catch her , maybe I could get the secret out of her . Yes, I must hurry up and catch her .” She left the pot boiling on the fire, and ran into the house to get the magic carpet. But her mother had already gone away on it. “Oh, no!” she muttered. She was very disappointed that she would not be able to catch the angel. She sat in front of the cauldron, sulking. “Oh, how can I ever become  as pretty as that?” She thought and thought and thought, but nothing came to her mind.Suddenly , she got an idea. “Maybe my mother has a formula in her magic books, to make me pretty , like an angel. Surely , she must have one.” Then she ran back into the house, and straight to her mother ’s closet. She rummaged about in the closet, looking for a recipe, turning over all of her mother ’s magic recipe books, one by one. But she couldn’ t find any recipe to become pretty , like an angel. She was very disappointed. She couldn’t stop thinking about the pretty angel. She paced up and down angrily , not wanting to give up. “Well,” she thought, “I’ll just have to come up with a recipe of my own, to make me beautiful.”She went back to the simmering cauldron and went on stirring it, still trying to think up a recipe. She became nervous and angry , because she couldn’t think of anything. “What ingredients should I use to make that magic portion?” she asked herself. She thought and thought, but she just couldn’t think of anything that would make her beautiful. After a while, Broccolina felt something rubbing against her ankle. It was her mother ’s grey cat. “Get away ,” she said. The cat wrapped herself around Broccolina’ s leg, mewing. It seemed to be lonely . Broccolina, who was already angry , became even angrier at that. “I said get away!” she yelled. When the cat didn’t leave, Broccolina grabbed it by the tail and flung it out of the door . ‘Yeow!’  The poor cat howled and ran away with her tail in the air . Just then, a long tail popped out from Broccolina’ s back. But, she was so absorbed in thoughts of becoming as beautiful as an angel, that she didn’ t feel it. She stirred the potion faster , thinking of the ingredients she should put in.Then her mother ’s black crow saw something strange hanging from Broccolina’ s back and flew to her . Thinking it was a snake, he pecked at it and pulled on it. Broccolina was angry about being disturbed again. She hit the crow with the stirring spoon. The crow’ s scrawny leg was scratched by the spoon and some of the potion spilled on the ground, as well. The poor crow shrieked in pain and quickly limped away . Broccolina was so mean, she didn’t care that she had wounded the poor crow . She didn’ t even feel sorry for him. She continued to stir the potion in the cauldron. Soon, small sores popped out all over her body . But, she was so absorbed in thoughts of becoming beautiful, that she didn’t notice them.The goat, her mother had brought home to slaughter for dinner , smelled the potion that had been spilt on the ground. He got up from his bed of hay and came to lick it up, because he was so thirsty . This angered Broccolina even more and she kicked the goat. The poor , thirsty goat staggered away , in fear and pain. And, in no time, she got a grey beard just like that of the goat, sprouted from her chin and her hair became coarse and stif f, like hay . But Broccolina didn’t notice it, because she was too busy , thinking about the ingredients she should put in her beauty potion.The cow in the barn, saw Broccolina’ s new beard and bristly hair . She was very hungry and thought that it was a stack of hay , so came to eat it. Broccolina, without realizing why the cow came to her , angrily threw a stick of firewood at her . It hit her on the horns and the poor hungry cow ran away , mooing in fear . Within seconds, two bumps emerged from the sides of Broccolina’ s head and grew into two big horns. But, still she didn’t notice!When her mother ’s watchdog saw this strange creature, he didn’ t know it was Broccolina. He sprang at her , barking and growling. Broccolina was very annoyed at him for barking at her and hit the dog with the cauldron’ s lid. It hit the dog on the mouth and the poor , stricken dog ran away , howling. Suddenly , half of Broccolina’ s teeth fell into the cauldron, as she stirred the potion. But Broccolina didn’t notice it, because she was too deep in thoughts of how to become pretty , like an angel. Then her mother ’slittle parrot woke up, hearing the clamour . When he saw Broccolina, he became frightened and flew about in his cage. “Oh! Broccolina,” the parrot cried,  “what happened to you? You’ve become uglier than ever . You are the ugliest being I’ve ever seen,” the little parrot screeched, in terror . Broccolina was furious. She shook his cage and shouted ugly words at him. As she shouted, her voice cracked and became hoarse, more like a croak, than a voice. “Oh! What’ s wrong?” Broccolina was very confused and felt that something was not right. She ran to the mirror . When she saw herself in the mirror she was horrified. “Oh, no!  No, nooooooooo...” she screamed. “Oh no, I wanted to be pretty like an angel.” She ran out of the house, screaming wildly . She was angrier than ever . She howled madly and crawled on the ground, cursing the angel.Hearing Broccolina’ s howling, the angel, who was on her way back to heaven, came to see what was wrong. When Broccolina saw the angel, she boiled with anger and jealousy .  “You horrible angel! You horrible angel!” Broccolina shouted indignantly , throwing up her hands. “All this happened to me, because of you,” she shouted. “Why did you fly above me? Ever since then, I wanted to become an angel like you.” The angel listened quietly . Broccolina went on complaining. “See, what has happened to me? I’ve ended up looking horrible. You’re responsible for all of this. Now, you must tell me, the secret of how to be pretty , like an angel. Otherwise I’ll teach you a lesson when I get my hands on you,” Broccolina shouted angrily .The angel listened to her calmly and spoke to her with kindness. “Broccolina, no magic potion can make anyone pretty like an angel. It’s not a secret. If you love and care for others, be kind and patient and do only good deeds, then you will look pretty , like an angel. The love in your heart for others is what really makes you beautiful.” Mouth agape, Broccolina listened intently to the angel. “A little while ago, you treated those poor creatures with meanness. That’ s how you became ugly . The more your heart is filled with cruelty and anger , the uglier you become,” said the angel. “Broccolina, now you must go to those you harmed, and care for them, until they get well. You should love them and talk to them with affection. You should never use harsh words on anyone. Then your voice will be sweeter .” The angel went away , fluttering her golden wings. Broccolina ran around in a panic, looking for the cat, the crow , the goat, cow , dog and parrot. They were all hiding from her , behind the barn, bruised and stricken with fear and pain. When they saw her , they became even more scared. But when she talked to them sweetly , they were so surprised, they forgot how frightened and hurt they had felt. Broccolina treated them lovingly and cared for their injuries with kindness.They were all very happy and amazed to hear kind words from her . Little by little, as she spoke to them nicely , her voice became sweeter and sweeter . As she treated the animals’  wounds with tenderness, her skin cleared and began to glow . When she nursed them with affection, her hair became soft and lustrous. When she looked at them with love in her eyes, her eyes became brighter and clearer . Little by little, she became pretty , just like the angel. Eventually , two little bumps appeared on her back and turned into lovely wings. “Oh!” She cried, as happy as she could be. She rose up into the air , fluttering her wings. Broccolina finally became an angel and flew to heaven. After that she was never unkind to anyone and was loved by all.","This is a story about a witch and her daughter Broccolina. Broccolina was only interested in becoming beautiful and spent most of her time in front of the mirror. One day, while her mother was away, she saw a beautiful angel and wanted to catch her to learn the secret to her beauty. When she couldn't catch the angel, she searched for a recipe to make herself pretty in her mother's magic books, but couldn't find any. She decided to come up with her own recipe and began stirring a magic potion. However, when her mother's cat and crow interrupted her, she became angry and hit them. A tail grew from her back, and sores appeared all over her body, but she was so focused on becoming beautiful that she didn't notice. The goat then licked up the spilled potion, and it's unclear what happened next.","['broccolina', 'witchcraft', 'witch', 'daughter', 'daughterone']"

The-Best-Christmas-Gift-FKB-Stories.txt,"Winter came and snow covered the valley home of the small fox, Bubu. All the animals   hid in their houses. Bubu didn't like the winter much, but there was one day for which   he was anxiously awaiting . . .Tomorrow was Christmas and Bubu was so excited that he could not fall asleep. What   gift would Santa Claus have for him? A new ball? Or skates? Or maybe a bicycle? Or   maybe—suddenly something flashed in the sky.What was it? A falling star? A plane? Or may be a giant bird? Whatever it was it   dropped beyond the Dark Forest. Bubu jumped from the bed and put on his scarf.Brrr . . . it was really cold outside. Earlier in the day, Bubu and his father had cleared   the snow from around the house, but the valley was still deeply covered in it.The road ahead would be difficult and frightful . . .He finally crossed the Dark Forest and started sniffing and looking around. Although he   sniffled a bit, his nose could still smell everything—and there was a smell of something   unknown.And finally he found it! It was a big red sack.  Very strange , thought Bubu. How is it possible for a sack to fall from the sky?  Sacks cannot fly  . . .  Then he opened it and everything became clear. . .This was Santa Claus’s sack! Here is the gift for the hedgehog, for the ducklings, for   the squirrel—for everyone. Evidently the sack had fallen from the sled when Santa   Claus flew above the valley.""This is great!"" said Bubu. He picked up as many presents as he could and hurried up   back to the valley.He first stopped at mole's house and looked through the window. It looked so nice and inviting   inside: the fire was burning in the fireplace and the Christmas tree glittered. Bubu wanted to go   home, but there was no way—these gifts must make it to their intended recipients—and so, he   placed the gift for mole near the door and left quickly.Then went to the house of the two rabbits and left their gifts. There was a laugh and   scuffle inside the house. Bubu enjoyed playing with the rabbits so very much, but this   night he had an important task to do.Then he stopped by the squirrel's tree. It was already late, and a quiet snore was heard   from inside. Bubu felt sleepy, so he pinched his tail, and then jumped up and hung the   gift in front of the hollow.Bubu delivered gifts the whole night. It was becoming harder and harder to move   forward, for a strong wind began to howl and push against him, and soon a heavy   snowstorm started.It was hard to go on in this snow storm. He couldn't see anything and only his sensitive   nose helped him to keep to the track.But then the snow storm become a blizzard, and Bubu, scared, frozen and weakened,   hid in the sack. He wanted so much to be at home with mommy and daddy. Bubu rolled   into a ball, wrapped himself with his tail and fell asleep.The wind continued to blow even stronger. The snow was covering Bubu's footprints   and Santa Claus’ sack . . .Bubu stretched his legs and woke up. He was covered with a thick blanket and was toasty warm.   He looked around surprised—he was at home, near the fireplace in the living room. ""Am I dreaming?"" wondered Bubu out loud. ""No, it is not a dream."" he heard a familiar voice.""Mommy! Daddy!"" exclaimed Bubu, filled with joy. ""You scared us so much, Bubu,"" said his mommy. ""All the animals were looking for you, but there were no   footprints. We were lucky that your father's big nose finally sensed your smell and, together with the moles,   we dug up the sack. The important thing is that you are safe and everyone got their Christmas gifts.""  ""Not everybody,"" said his father. ""When we found you, there was one gift left in the sack: your gift. Come on,   open it. Let us see what Santa brought you.""Bubu smiled and said,   ""I already got the best Christmas gift. This night I found out that the only thing I want for   Christmas is to be home with you and Mommy. This is better than a sack full of gifts.""","The story is about a small fox named Bubu who is excited for Christmas and wonders what gift he will receive from Santa Claus.

I’ve  tried that one before  and it didn’t work out  very well for me.10I could grab the toy  that I want to have.  No!

Youth-Coming-Out-Handbook-FKB.txt,"Exploring your sexual orientation  and/or gender identity  can bring up a lot  of feelings and questions. Inside this handbook,  we will work together to explore your identity,  what it might be like to share your identity with  others, and provide you with tools and guiding  questions to help you think about what coming  out means to you. The Trevor Project’s Coming Out: A Handbook  for LGBTQ Young People  is here to help you nav - igate questions around your identity. You know  yourself and what works for you better than any - one else. Each of us has the right to share or not  share different aspects of ourselves with others.  No one else is entitled to information around  your identities, if you do not want them to know.  If you choose not to share parts of your identity  with others, it does not make you any less valid  than those who may choose to share their identi - ties with other people. “I’ve slowly been fig - uring out who I really  am, and every step of  the way I like who I find  more and more.”   —Hayley, 16 (Virginia) You may have heard people talking about “com - ing out” before in ways that are oversimplified,  judgmental, or just plain scary. The truth is that  there is no one way to “come out” or be “out.”  There may be certain people in our lives with  whom we want to share our sexual orientation  and/or gender identity, and there may be others  with whom we know that we do not feel com - fortable or safe sharing. This is more than okay! Some people may share their identity with a few  trusted friends online, some may choose to share  with a counselor or a trusted family member, and  others may want everyone in their life to know  about their identity. An important thing to know  is that for a lot of people, coming out doesn’t just  happen once. A lot of folks find themselves com - ing out at different times to different people. It is all about what works for you, wherever you  are at. The things you hear about coming out  may make you feel pressured to take steps that  don’t feel right for you, or that you don’t feel pre - pared for. Your experience is truly unique to you.  You get to decide. This handbook is here to help  you think through what might be best for you. After thinking it through, you may decide to be  out to yourself, but not to anyone else — and  that’s okay. Many people choose not to come  out to others for different reasons. You are val - id and deserve support no matter who you do or  do not share your identities with. This resource is  for you to explore how you feel and what choices  are right and safe for you.IDENTITY Gender identity and sexual orientation can be significant parts of who we are. And for many of us,  there are lots of other aspects of ourselves that are meaningful and help make us the people we are.  All of these identities help shape us into ourselves. Race, ethnicity, (dis)ability, national origin, the lan - guage(s) we speak, age, social class, religion/spirituality, and many other identity categories help us  tell a larger picture about what it means to be us. Gender identity and sexual orientation can be just  one piece of the puzzle. We are all complex human beings, and that is wonderful! THE BASICS Questioning your identity is an experience  that lots of people have many times through - out their life. Identity is complicated and if you  aren’t sure how you identify, that’s ok! You  are allowed to not have everything figured  out right at this moment. Taking some time  to think through how you feel can be helpful  in better understanding your gender identity,  gender expression, and/or sexual orientation. Many people aren’t sure of the difference be - tween gender identity, gender expression, sex  assigned at birth, and sexual orientation. It  isn’t something many of us are taught. Instead,  lots of us end up figuring out what these cat - egories mean on our own. Let’s spend some  time breaking down the difference between  each of these terms and exploring what they  mean together. What Is Sex Assigned at Birth? When we are born, doctors decide whether “female” or “male” will be listed on our birth certificate.  This is often one of the first instances when gender is ascribed to us. This sex assignment at birth is  typically based solely on one’s genitals. Just like a lot of the concepts in this handbook, sex assign - ment at birth is far more intricate than meets the eye. The label of one’s sex assignment at birth is often attributed to a child before they can speak, walk,  or know for themselves what their gender identity is. As such, sex assignment does not take into ac - count one’s true gender identity. Your true gender may be different than the gender that a doctor  assigned you, which is perfectly normal, valid, and wonderful. Additionally, there is so much diversity between bodies. For some babies, their bodies do not fit  neatly into the category of “male” or “female.” These people may come to identify themselves as in - tersex, which is a term used for “a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive  or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male” (Intersex Society  of North America). It is not always an easy process to figure out what your sex assignment at birth and your gender  mean to you, so we want to take a moment to recognize all that it took to discover who you are. What Is Gender? Some people say that gender looks like this: Boy Girl Others say that gender is this: Boy Girl In actuality, gender often looks a lot like this: Now, let’s zoom in! Gender Identity Gender Identity describes our internal understanding and experience of our own gender. Each per - son’s experience with their gender identity is unique and personal. Some people think that there are only two gender identities possible: boy or girl. But, in fact, thou - sands and thousands of people experience their gender outside of this gender binary (binary mean - ing made up of two things) . Some people identify as being both a boy and a girl, or being neither a boy  nor a girl. Some folks identity as a gender that is different than boy or girl, or they don’t experience  gender at all. Non-binary is a term that refers to people who don’t experience their gender(s) as com - pletely a girl/woman or boy/man. Think of how many different ways there are to be a boy or a girl; there are millions of different ways  to be non-binary too. Throughout the course of history and all around the world, there have always  been people who experience their gender(s) in diverse ways.While many people identify with the sex they were assigned at birth, some people may find that their  gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Exploring your gender is normal at  all ages and at any stage of life. All of these experiences are equally valid. How do I experience my gender? How do I feel in relation to the sex I was assigned at birth? What does gender mean to me? It can be helpful to visualize how you experience gender. Below is a Gender Identity map where  you can mark how you identify in terms of gender identity. Maybe you can make a single dot on  this graphic, maybe you place yourself using five separate dots, maybe your identity needs a circle  around one large area, or more. We give you the freedom to mark the map one way today, and an  entirely different way tomorrow, a month, or a year from now. Your identity may shift fluidly or stay  the same. All experiences are welcome here! Agender/ GenderlessBoy/ManGirl/Woman Non-Binary Gender Expression Gender Expression describes the way in which we present ourselves, which can include physical ap - pearance, clothing, hairstyles, and behavior. Gender identity is not the same as gender expression. It is important to not assume that the way that  someone moves, talks, dresses, or styles their hair is indicative of how they identify their gender.  There are an infinite amount of amazing ways to be a person of any gender. Some boys wear dresses,  some girls have short hair, and some non-binary folks wear makeup. Gender expression is all about how you want to present. If you are not currently able to express your gender the way that you wish  you could, we stand with you. You are still you! How do I like to present my gender? In an ideal situation, how would I want to express my gender? What aspects of gender expression make me feel happy and authentically myself? What aspects of gender expression make me feel sad and not like myself? If you like, you can mark on the Gender Expression Map below with how you experience your gen - der expression. It is always more than okay to allow room for feelings to shift over time. Maybe your  gender expression stays mostly in the androgynous part of the map, or maybe it fluctuates between  masculine and feminine, or somewhere in between. Maybe you prefer to express yourself in a gen - derless way. Your map gets to reflect the personal relationship you have with your gender expression. GenderlessMasculine/Masc/ButchFeminine/FemmeAndrogynousTransitioning Some people might go through a process called transitioning. Transitioning can refer to any social,  legal, and/or medical steps individuals take to affirm their gender identity or gender expression. Not  everyone wants to take some or any of these steps, and that is okay — this doesn’t make them any  less of who they are. Transitioning for some looks like using a new set of pronouns or wearing differ - ent clothing and/or going through the process of changing one’s name on legal documents or chang - ing one’s gender marker on a driver’s license and/or going on hormones or getting surgery to affirm  one’s gender. Not all people who identify with gender(s) other than the one they were assigned at  birth choose to transition. And for those who do, the process can look millions of different ways. There is no single path to living as your true gender. You get to decide if transitioning is something  that is important to you and/or how it looks for your gender, your body, and your life. What Is Sexual Orientation? Some people say that sexual orientation is this: Others say sexual orientation is this: Just like gender, sexual orientation is more expansive too. Sexual Orientation Sexual Orientation includes different forms of attraction, behaviors, and identities. For a long time,  many people saw all forms of attraction as the same thing. As language has expanded, more and  more people have come to understand that different forms of attraction can be parsed out and talk - ed about as distinct categories. Sexual, physical, romantic, and emotional attraction are four major ways that people have differenti - ated forms of desire. While these are the most commonly talked about categories describing attrac - tion, there are other types as well, including mental, sensual, and aesthetic. In our society, it is often assumed that each person is heterosexual (meaning they only are attracted  to people of a different gender). It is also assumed that we all experience sexual/physical, romantic,  and emotional attraction as the same thing. While some people find that their sexual orientation  matches up with these expectations, some folks do not. It is very normal to find ourselves ques - tioning our sexual orientation. Despite what we may have been taught, attraction can look so many  amazing, unique ways. Whether you experience all of the categories of attraction as the same, or feel  varying amounts of each, or no attraction at all, there are lots of other people out there feeling the  same way. You also might experience attraction towards just one gender, multiple genders, or differ - ent genders of people at different times in your life. You are never too young or too old to question  your sexual orientation. Your sexual orientation is real and legitimate no matter what.Let’s explore the different types of attraction in more depth below: Sexual Attraction Sexual Attraction is typically the first thing that comes to mind when people think about sexual ori - entation or attraction in general. This type of attraction is characterized by the desire to be sexually  intimate with other people. Physical attraction is often considered a piece of sexual attraction. It can  be described as who you find physically attractive. Am I interested in being sexually intimate with others? Who am I interested in being sexually intimate with? Who do I find physically attractive? How often do I experience feelings of sexual/physical attraction? Feel free to mark below with how you experience sexual/physical attraction. You can use the guiding  questions above to get you thinking about where you might land on the map. No Sexual Attraction Attracted to Non-Binary PeopleAttracted to WomenAttracted to MenRomantic Attraction Romantic Attraction is often described as the desire for romantic intimacy or romantic relation - ships with others. For some, this could mean wanting to hold hands, go on dates, kissing and/or cud - dling. The list goes on, and it’s all about how you personally feel around each of these expressions  of romance. Have I ever had a crush on someone before? Who have I had crushes on? Who do I want to experience romantic behaviors with? Who do I want to experience romantic relationships with? How do you experience romantic attraction? Mark below on the Romantic Attraction Map with the  ways in which you do or do not feel romantic attraction.

This could look like wanting to become best friends with someone or feeling emotionally “drawn” to  someone based on their personality. Who do I have strong desires to be emotionally close to? Who do I feel an emotional bond towards? Who do I want to get to know better? We encourage you to plot out how emotional attraction looks for you below. Where do you  find yourself? No Emotional AttractionAttracted to Men Attracted to Non-Binary PeopleAttracted to WomenCOMING OUT Coming out to yourself or someone else is an incredibly personal decision. There’s no right or wrong  way to do it. It’s completely up to you and your relationship with who you might share it with. For  those who want to come out, taking stock of who in your life supports and encourages you, and helps  you feel less alone can make a big difference. There are lots of different ways to come out! Here are just a few examples: • Calling someone on the phone • Sending a text • Sending an email • Writing a letter • Talking with someone in person Planning Ahead You might decide to take some time to prepare what you want to say. Writing out how you might  want to come out to someone can be useful. Practicing with supportive people can also help in figur - ing out what you want to say and how you want to say it. How do I want to come out to them? What would I say to someone I want to come out to? What would I expect them to say? Is there a way I would want to prepare prior to coming out? If you are thinking about coming out, it can be important to think about the range of reactions peo - ple may have, including the good ones and the bad ones. Here are some questions to think through  how they might react: What are some of the good responses I may hear? What are some of the bad responses I may hear? What do I expect their reactions will be, based on what I know about the person I’m sharing with? How do I want them to react? Keep in mind that other people’s reactions can be quite varied.Testing The Waters Figuring out how people feel about LGBTQ people and topics can give you an idea about how they  might possibly react (though not always). Some ways that other people have tested the waters: Asking how they feel about an LGBTQ celebrity Asking how they feel about marriage equality Listening to their words: Do they put down LGBTQ people? Do they invoke LGBTQ stereotypes? Noticing how they handle difficult emotional events, which can help you guess what reactions to be ready for Sometimes the people we come out to ask a lot of questions. It’s okay to not have all the answers; it  is not your job to be the expert on your identities. If you feel comfortable, you are always welcome  to answer these potential questions, but you don’t owe anyone any information that you aren’t com - fortable sharing. Environment Timing  There is no perfect time to come out. In fact, the best time will probably change depending on who  you want to tell. Sometimes it is helpful to wait for a time when the person you tell feels relaxed,  open, and willing to listen. Other times, you may need to share at a random moment. It is about  whenever it feels right to you. Here are some questions to think through to explore timing that might  work for you: What time works best for me to come out? What time of day feels like a good time to share? (before school, after work, during dinner, etc.) What time of year feels like a good time to share? (school season, summer, holidays, etc.) What time works best for the person I want to come out to? Location Like timing, there is also no perfect place to come out. Some places might be safer or more comfort - able for you than others. Would I rather be in a public or private space? Does home feel like a safe place to talk? Where would we both be comfortable talking? Is there a location special to me and the person I’m talking with?School  Coming out at school can be a great way for some to connect with other LGBTQ classmates. School  can also be an unsafe space for many people. When thinking about coming out at school, make sure  to keep your safety and wellness in mind. You may want to make a safety plan for school if you feel  like you might face some tough times. How would being out at school make me feel? Who would I want to share with at school? Are there supportive faculty members, counselors, teachers or adults at my school? Is there a Gender & Sexuality Alliance (GSA) or similar club/community that I feel comfortable attending? Are there anti-bullying rules that protect LGBTQ students that are enforced? Will coming out put my safety at risk? If so, what steps can I take to stay safe? Support Think about people in your life who would support you no matter what. Who do I feel safe with? Who do I feel comfortable sharing about my life with? Who in my life has my back no matter what? Who in my life builds up my confidence? These supportive people could be: • Real-life and online friends, classmates • Team members, school club members, online communities • Teachers, counselors, doctors, co-workers • Family members, caretakers, parents, siblings, cousins, neighbors • Religious or spiritual leaders Safety Around Coming Out Unfortunately, coming out doesn’t always go according to our hopes and plans. If people don’t re - act the way we wish, it does not reflect on the realness of our identities, and it is not our fault. You  deserve to be accepted with open arms, care, and love. In situations where things are feeling unsafe  or you expect that they might be, it could make sense to prepare a back-up plan for housing, food,  school, and/or transportation, just in case. Your safety and well-being are of the utmost priority. And  The Trevor Project is always here for you and has your back. Check out the Resources section in the back for local and/or online resources that can be a support  before, during, and after coming out.HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS As you explore your identity and coming out, a very important part of that process can be the consid - eration of dating and/or starting a relationship with special someone(s). With that can come a great  deal of excitement and even a bit of anxiety as you get to know someone new. While navigating this process, it is important to know the difference between a healthy relationship  and one that might be unhealthy. Only you can define your expectations, boundaries, and needs. Re - member, you reserve the right to express when something doesn’t feel right, and we all deserve to  feel safe and secure with people we are dating. • Healthy relationships can be are characterized by trust, honesty, mutual respect, open  communication and most importantly feeling safe and secure. • Unhealthy relationships may be characterized by elements of control, sometimes mani - festing physically, emotionally, and/or sexually. Violence, coercion, or force of any kind is  not healthy and does not create a safe, respectful space for all partners. • Consent to engage in sexual, physical, and/or romantic intimacy is extremely important  and must be enthusiastically and freely given by each person. You always have the right  to say no or stop an intimate experience, no matter the reason, no matter if you’ve been  intimate with that person before, and no matter if you consented to another behavior  earlier. This goes for the person/people you are being intimate with as well. Everyone  must consent. SELF-CARE Coming out and learning more about yourself can sometimes feel like a roller coaster — full of emo - tional ups and downs. To stay healthy, it’s important to discover what helps you feel cared for, re - laxed, and able to cope with everything that’s going on. This is called “self-care,” and it’s about taking  care of YOU. Coming up with some go-to self-care ideas can be a helpful way to make your mental  and physical health a priority. Sometimes we all need a little extra self-care when times are tough.  Checking in on how you’re feeling mentally, emotionally, and physically is a great way to help keep  track of when this might be needed for you. Here are some ideas for a self care plan: 1. Call, text, or chat with a friend for support 2. Talk to a supportive person in your life if you’re feeling sad or unsafe 3. Identify safe places you can go to if you need to get away from a stressful situation 4. Connect with a trained counselor via TrevorLifeline, TrevorText, or TrevorChat 5. Log on to TrevorSpace.org to connect with other LGBTQ young people 6. Focus on your interests: Do something you enjoy. Write your thoughts out in a journal  or create an art project to express your feelings 7. Connect with your body: Take deep breaths. Take a shower or bath. Some people find  movement like yoga, walking, or running helpful. You know your body best and what  feels good for you 8. Put on headphones and listen to your favorite music 9. Watch your favorite TV show and relax 10. Remind yourself that you are a valuable person exactly as you are When I’m having a hard time, what do I do to cope? What helps me stay healthy, relaxed and positive? Who could I call, text, or chat with if I need support? What are my favorite things to do? What are my goals for the future? What are some self-care activities I want to try out?“Most of the time, I relieve my stress by writing. Also, I  make sure to laugh and have fun, despite my difficult  situations.”    —Brad, 18 (California) Checking in on Your Mental Health Warning Signs  Feeling sad or alone can be overwhelming, especially if people in your life are unsupportive. While  these feelings are completely normal, it’s important to keep an eye out for warning signs of larger  mental health struggles. You are not alone and asking for help is a sign of strength.

Thank you Please make a donation on Patreon to support Monkey Pens Free Book Project:James, his sister Sally, and Mark, their BFF (Best Friend  Forever) were bored. They had played all day but now that  it was dark and difficult to see, they had nothing to do. They couldn’t play soccer because they couldn’t see the  ball. They didn’t want to go inside and play a game because  it was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being  outside, especially after having to play inside all winter  long. They just didn’t know what to do and it was a little  too early for them to go home. “I guess I’ll just go home,” Mark said in a sad voice. “Aww  come on,” replied James. “We still have time for another  game of – of something.” Then Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek.”“I was just going to say that,” James said. “Yah, I’ll bet,”  replied his sister. “You always say you were thinking of  whatever I think of,” she snapped. “Do not!” James said in  a loud voice. “Do too,” yelled Sally. Mark just looked down at the ground and shook his head  from side to side. “They are at it again,” he mumbled to  himself. Then he yelled, “Okay, let’s play Hide-and-Seek I’ll be the seeker!” He turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started  counting out loud. “100 – 99 – 98 – 97 …..” Sally and Mark  stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in  different directions to find a hiding place. In the distance they could still hear Mark counting  “4 – 3 – 2 – 1. Ready or not, here I come!” Then he turned and began looking for places  where they could be hiding.Finding Sally was easy. She always ran off and then circled back so she would be close to “base,” the safe place to get to before being tagged. Mark looked for the biggest tree and ran towards it. But she wasn’t there. “I’ll bet she’s behind that big bush,” he said to himself. So he ran to it and was ready to tag her, but she wasn’t there either. As he turned around, he saw James running towards “base” and darted after him. Just before he touched James’ shoulder, James tagged the “base” and yelled out “SAFE!” “Did you get Sally yet?” James asked. “No,” said Mark. “I haven’t been able to find her and it’s getting late and we need to be heading home.”So both boys yelled out “Come on out Sally, it’s late.” But there was no reply. Not even a little snicker from somewhere in the darkness. They yelled again. “Come on out Sally, it’s late.” Still there was no reply from Sally. They began to worry and started searching for her. As  they walked around the area they called out “Sally, come  on, we give up; you’re safe.” But no matter where they looked, or how much they called out, Sally didn’t answer. It was as if she disappeared.Sally was wondering what had happened. All she could remember was crawling under the big trunk of a fallen tree to hide. Now, as she looked up, she saw several stars through a small hole above her head. She had fallen into a hole when she crawled under the tree trunk. “Help!” she yelled and heard her voice echo throughout what must have been a cave. “HELP!  Help, help, help!”“Did you hear that, James?” Mark said excitedly. “Sally just yelled for help.” “Keep yelling Sally,” James screamed. “That way we can find you.” Sally heard her brother and kept screaming. After a short while the boys were  standing next to the big tree trunk. “Hey! Are you stuck under this tree?” asked James. “Kind of,” Sally yelled. “When I crawled under it to hide, I fell into a cave. Please help me, I’m scared. It’s dark and I can’t get out.”Mark said, “James you stay with Sally and I will go get my dad.” Then he dashed off into the darkness. “Don’t be scared,” James said. “I am right here with you.” “No, you’re not,” Sally sobbed. “You’re up there and I’m down here.” As Sally turned in the darkness of the cave, she bumped into something, screamed, and began to cry.“What’s wrong?” James yelled. “There’s something down here with me,” Sally replied in a shaky voice. Just then, Mark and his dad came running through the woods. Mark’s father knelt down and asked Sally if she was okay. He could hear her crying and sobbing.  “Sally, are you hurt?” he asked. “No,” she said. “But I’m scared and there is something down here with me.” “Stand back Sally. I am lowering a rope and will be down with you in a second.”Mark’s dad tied the rope to the tree, found the hole under the tree trunk, wiggled a bit, and lowered himself into the cave. Sally could see him coming down the rope and stopped crying. Not only was he there but the cave became  brighter from the beam of his flashlight as it danced across the cave’s floor and walls.As he reached the floor of the cave, he shone the light on Sally and gave her a big hug. “Don’t be frightened,” he said. “I’ll have you out of here in no time.”  Then he shone the light around and saw that she had fallen into a small cave.  And very close to her, in the middle of the cave, was something wrapped in layers of old blankets.“Mark, James, there’s something down here.  I am going to tie it to the rope and I want you to  pull it out.” “Okay,” they replied. The boys pulled out the object, untied it, and let the loose end of the rope fall back into the cave. The cave wasn’t deep and Marks’ dad boosted Sally over his head so she could  crawl out. He then grabbed the rope and with a little jump, was able to grab the opening and pull himself out.“Let’s go back to my house for a cup of hot tea. I’ll call your parents so they aren’t worried, and we’ll see what treasure Sally found.” He said.When they got to Mark’s house, they sipped their tea and began unwrapping the treasure. They carefully peeled off layers of old blankets and cloth to reveal a wooden box. They slowly opened it and stared in amazement. “Oh my,” Sally said in disbelief. “I don’t believe what I am seeing.” The boys and Mark’s father just stared. Inside the box were jewels of every color you could imagine.  There were diamonds,rubies, sapphires, and emeralds  of all shapes and sizes.Intermixed they could see several gold coins and strands of pearls.“We’re rich,” the boys  screamed. “Not quite,” interrupted Mark’s father. “Someone  could have lost this and I don’t think you should plan on  spending any of it until we find out a little more. Besides,  Sally found it.” “I’ll share it,” Sally said happily. “That’s nice  Sally,” replied Marks dad. But the right thing to do is contact the authorities.”The next day, the four of them and Sally’s mother drove to the police station,  explained what had happened, and gave the treasure to the police to hold while  they conducted their investigation. They left the police station sadly and even the double dipped ice cream cones  Mark’s father bought for them didn’t make them smile.They drove back in silence.Several weeks passed with no word from the police. Then, one evening, Mark’s father called James, Sally, and their parents. “The police just called and I think you should come over right now,” he said. “I’m afraid there is some bad news about the treasure. The police are on their way and will explain everything when you get here.”Sally and James didn’t say much during the ride to Mark’s house. Sally thought that since it was “bad news” the treasure belonged to someone else, even though they probably lost it. “Whatever happened to ‘finders-keepers’?” she mumbled. “What did you say Sally?” her mother asked. “Oh, nothing.” Sally replied. Then she let out a long, sad sigh that echoed through the car.Sally, Mark, and James shrieked with joy and danced around the room. Then Sally said, “What is the bad news?” The captain smiled and said. “The treasure is worth more money than you can imagine and with your new found wealth comes great responsibility.” Sally didn’t quite understand  what the captain was talking about and right now it really didn’t matter.Mark asked, “Are you going to share?” “Of course,” Sally said. “If you and James didn’t help me I might still be there.” Several days later Sally asked everyone over to her house. “I have decided what to do with the money from the treasure after it is sold,” she said. “I am giving 1/6 to our Mom and Dad, 1/6 to Mark’s Mom and Dad, 1/6 to Mark, 1/6 to James, and 1/6 for me.” “There is an extra 1/6,” Mark proudly stated. He loved math and was right on top of Sally’s calculations.“No there’s not,” Sally said. “Is too,” James said. “Is not,” Sally said in an angered voice. Just as Mark was going to say, “They are at it again,” Sally said, “This is why there isn’t an extra 1/6! I am giving it to the local charity, so it can be given to those less  fortunate and in need.” Her mother and father said it was a caring and responsible thing to do. They were very proud of her and knew that she understood what the captain meant when he had turned the treasure over to her just days before.","he story is about three children, James, Sally, and Mark, who are bored and looking for something to do. Sally suggests they play hide-and-seek, and they all agree. While playing, Sally falls into a cave and becomes trapped.

A-House-for-a-Mouse-R-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt,"Deep in the dark of the house, nighttime silence woke Whiskers.  He yawned.Whiskers jumped up to explore. Pale yellow light made purple shadows on the ﬂoor. The house was quiet.He ran down a long, lighted hallway. This house was ﬁne for a hungry mouse. This was a house for a mouse.With his pink nose to the carpet, Whiskers smelled something wonderful. He squeezed under a dark door at the end of the long hall.Whiskers quickly climbed up a thick, heavy blanket. He hustled across lumpy terrain and slid down a steep, slick hill. He rolled into peanut bits, cookie crumbs and tortilla chips. Just as he was about to snack, the ground moved beneath his paws. Screams ﬁlled the room, terrifying Whiskers.Up he ﬂew. Up into the air with chips and blanket. A bright light blinded his eyes. He jumped to the ﬂoor and ran for the door. As he escaped, a swat stung his tail. Whiskers raced back to his warm bed and hid under his sister. “What is all the racket?” cried Cheesepuff, a little white furry ball. “A huge monster in the house,”  gulped Whiskers, “as big as a mountain with a bright, shiny eye  and a terrible tail-whacker.”Cheesepuff sniffed the air and shuddered, “It is a human. I told you this house would be trouble. We will have to move. We need a house for a mouse.”“But,” said Whiskers, “this is our home.””Then they will have to leave,”  Cheesepuff declared.“No,” said Whiskers, “we have to  live together.”In the morning an orange van parked in front of the house. Men in white suits put sticky traps all around the house next to Whisker and Cheesepuff’s favorite hunting sites. That night, Whiskers snifﬂed a delicious tray  and cautiously dipped his paw into tasty goop. His paw stuck in the muck and he cried out for his sister. Cheesepuff tugged and pulled until his paw popped out of the sticky glop. The mice  waited many    days for the traps   to disappear. They were getting very hungry. Then Whiskers had an idea. “Let’s leave the humans a present and maybe they will let us stay.” Cheesepuff did not think it was a good idea, and she hid in her bed while Whiskers carefully picked fresh herbs and petals. He pulled out a small bag from their treasure box and ﬁlled it  full of fragrant lavender and pretty pink petals.Cheesepuff watched when Whiskers left their gift by the dreadful tray in the living room. His paw prints were stamped all over the bag.In the morning, the mice heard shouts, voices and crying. Soon, all the traps were gone. When the sister and brother peeked into the kitchen that night, there was a big package where a trap had been sitting. Whiskers was suspicious. “Don’t get too close,” he whispered as he stared at the odd sight.“But they have left us a pretty present,” said Cheesepuff as she snufﬂed the pink, polka dot wrapping paper with her nose.The two mice tore the paper and found a very curious construction. Whiskers rolled into soft wood shavings on the ﬂ  oor and bumped a bowl ﬁ  lled with peanut bits, cookie crumbs and tortilla chips. He ran on a big wheel that turned round and round. Cheesepuff followed him and found a carrot in one corner.“I’m all wet,” she cried when she leaned on the water bottle. “It’s a house!” said Cheesepuff. “Our very own house. A home made just our size.” 1617 17 “Our very own house,” Whiskers repeated. “Now, this is a house for a mouse!”","The story follows two mice named Whiskers and Cheesepuff as they explore a house at night in search of food. They encounter a human and sticky traps that threaten their safety. In an attempt to make peace with the humans, Whiskers leaves a gift of herbs and petals that leads to the humans building them a custom-made mouse house. The story ends with the mice happy in their new home, declaring it a house for a mouse.","['whiskers', 'whisker', 'mice', 'escaped', 'whacker']"

Kiwi_book-FKB.txt,"Why I care about  Kiwis? I started by watching a video about  kiwis and got really sad because the video said that kiwi birds were  endangered. So I  wrote this article  to spread awareness about kiwi  birds.Kiwi Evolution  The ancestors of the kiwi birds flew from Madagascar and Australia to  New Zealand. Since they were able  to fly such long distances the they  probably had strong wings. Once  they settled down in New Zealand  they didn't use their wings, as there  were no land predators to hunt  them. Slowly, after many manygenerations they evolved  to have  small and weak wings that could  not lift them any more. When we humans came to  New  Zealand, we brought other animals  (land predators), like stoats, weasels, cats, and dogs who hunted the kiwi  birds. Defenseless against these  introduced predators, the kiwi bird   became endangered. Sadly, wecontinue to lose 2 percent of them  every year.Kiwi Features Kiwi birds have mammalian and  bird-like features. Their  feathers  are fur like in shape. They moult,  which means they drop feathers  and re-grow them, through out the  year. Kiwi birds also have whiskers  like cats.Most birds have hollow bones as  they need to be light to fly, but kiwi  birds have bones full of bone  marrow as they are flightless. Most kiwi bird females have 1  ovary, but some have 2 ovaries.  Kiwi birds have nostrils on the end  of their beak, and their sense ofsmell is very strong. Since kiwi  birds have stout and powerful legs,  they are fast runners.Types of Kiwis The country of New Zealand is  made up of many many islands.  There are 2 big islands called North Island and South Island. There are 5 types of kiwi birds. 1.Roroa  lives in the north west of  South Island and it’s scientific  name is Apertex Haastii. 2.Little Spotted Kiwi  lives  scattered around the tiny  islands of New Zealand and it’s  scientific name is Apertex  Owenii..Rowi  lives in the middle of the  west coast of South Island and  it’s scientific name is Apertex  Rowi. 4.Common Kiwi  is found in the  south-west coast of South  Island and in Stewart Island  which is a part of south land .  It’s scientific name is Apertex  Australius..North Island Brown Kiwi  lives  in North Island and it’s  scientific name is Apertex  Manteil.Lifestyle Kiwi birds are nocturnal. In the  daytime kiwi birds live in giant  holes in the ground called kiwi  nests. Kiwi birds come out at nightto hunt, play and eat. Kiwi birds  usually live for 25-50 years.Conservation of Kiwis The Department of Conservation  monitors the male kiwi birds forthose incubating egg. When the  eggs are partially incubated, they  take them from the male kiwi and  give the eggs to the kiwi hatchery  which artificially completes the  incubation process. The process of  incubation takes 78 days. Then the  egg hatches. After that, they raise  the kiwi till it is 1kg in weight. Then  the Department of Conservation  returns it to the wild. The kiwi eggweighs 450 grams which is 25% of  the weight of the adult kiwi bird.","This text is about the kiwi bird, an endangered species native to New Zealand. It explains the evolution of the kiwi bird's wings, its unique features, the different types of kiwis, their lifestyle, and conservation efforts to protect them. The Department of Conservation monitors and artificially completes the incubation process of kiwi eggs, raises them until they reach 1kg in weight, and then returns them to the wild to help preserve the species.","['kiwis', 'kiwi', 'birds', 'endangered', 'bird']"

King-of-the-Killers-R-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt," 1 “Who’s coming?”  she asked .  “The Kin g of the Killers! Run while you can!”  wailed  a hadrosaur .  Lila did not run. She yawned, lay on  her rock and waited.   A moment later  she heard the thump of heavy feet. Trees crunched and crashed.   Branches snapped like str aw.   “RRRAARLL!!”           With a horrib le howl, a  Tyrannosaurus Rex charg ed through the trees  and  stamped over to the lake .   It stopped at the water’s edge. Then it  glared around , looking  for someone to eat .   The only animal it could see was Lila , the little brown lizard . Lower ing its  massive head, the T Rex  bared its  teeth  at her .   “Why haven’t you run? ” it snarled.  “Haven’t you heard? The King of the Killers  is here!”   “No, he  isn’t,” said Lila calmly.   The T Rex shook its head and roared.   “You don’t understand. It’s ME! I’m  the King of the Ki llers!”  2 Lila cast a lazy eye over the T Rex . It was a very big dinosaur, but it was also  very young. “No, you’re not,” she said.     “Yes, I am too!” it bellowed. “ I’m bigger than all my brothers and sisters!  I’m  the King of the T Rex es.”  “So?” said Lila.   “Rex means King! So I’m King  twice over . King King, that ’s me! Now p repare  to be gobbled up , you measly mouthful !”   King King opened his great mouth wide , ready to snap  Lila up. But Lila did not  move.   “Don’t bother eating me,” she said. “Measly mouthful is right.  I’m small and   tough and stringy. What’s more,  I’m n ot afraid . I’ve seen bigger  killer s than you .”  “What ? Who? Where? ” yelped King King in alarm. He whirled around .   But h e could not spot another dinosaur anywhere.  Thumping  his tail in anger ,  King Ki ng roared,  “You ’re lying! Stringy or not, I’m going to eat you  up!”    Lila pointed at the lake . “Before you do, just look over there,” she said .  King King gazed  across the lake . His eyes widened.   On the o pposite shore  was a very fearsome  dinosaur  indeed . Its huge head was  crammed  with at least a hundred long, sharp teeth.       3 Its eyes were  small  and mean . Its tail thrashed from side to side as it strode  around the lake.  And it was coming  towards them .  “Hey!” gasped  King King. “Wh o’s that ?”  “That’s  Tyrannoti tan,” Lila  said. “He’s  bigger than you.”   “Bigger than me?  He can’t be! Are you sure?”   Lila shrugged . “We’ll soon know,” she said. “Titan will be here in a few  minutes. He heard you bellowing , and he’s come to see who’s in his hunting  ground.”   “I’m not scar ed!” said King King  in a slightly wobbly  voice . “I can beat that  Titan in a battle any day!”   “Quite right,” yawned Lila. “I’m not scared of Titan either.”   “You’re not?”   “Oh no,” said Lila , “because I didn’t  actually mean  him. I was pointing at that.”  She p ointed again at the lake, just beyond the reeds.   King King  stared at its still surface . Suddenly  the lake rippled. T he reeds  shuddered . The water  heaved.   Then,  with a mighty  WHOOSH  of waves,  there emerged the biggest  head that he  had ever seen.   It held at least  a thousand wicked  teeth . And it was attached to a dripping body  that was even bigger than Titan .     4 The new dinosaur gl owered at King King . Then it began to wade ou t of the  water. It was enormous . King King backed away.   “Wh– what is it? ” he quave red.  “That’s a spinosaurus, ” Lila said. “See the row of spines along its back? They  make a sort of sail. Quite scary, isn’t it?”   King King gulped. “I’m not scared!  Um– what does it eat?”   “Meat, fish,  dinosaurs ; anything  that moves ,” said Lila. “ That isn’t the King of  the Killer s, though. ”  “Oh, g ood!”   “No, she’s the Queen. That’s  Queen  Spinechilla : and this is her lake . She really  doesn’t care for strange young  dinosaurs thumping round it. ”  “Oh,” said King King faintly . He stood and stared, not knowing what to do .  The t wo huge  predators were heading straight towards him. They both looked  bigger  and faster  than he was – and much, much meaner.   And now it  was too late for him to run.         5 Chapter Two     The ground shook  as Titan stamped around the shore.   The lake swirled as Spinechilla lurched out in a tidal wave.   “Help!” whimpered King King. “What do I do  now?”  “If you  want to be King of the Killers , you need to challenge them,” said Lila.   “But they’re bound to win!”  he wailed, cowering behind Lila’s rock. It did n’t  even hide one foot .  “No, they’re not,” said Lila.   “Yes , they are . They’re bigger than me !” cried  King King . He dashed behind a  tree-fern. It didn’t even hide one leg.   “Maybe  they are  bigger ,” said Lila, “but how big are their brains? That’s what  really  counts.”       “What?” said King King, trying to bury his head in the sand.   She sighed. “Come out of there.  I’ll help you win  – if you’ll promise me one  thing.”   “What ’s that ?”  “Never to  eat me or my family.”   “I promise! I promise!” said King King, shaking sa nd out of his ears.   6 “All right. Now,  listen carefully. You’r e going to challenge th ose two  to a race.”  “But they’ll beat me!” protested the T Rex.   “Trust me,” Lila said. “ Go on!  Show them you’re  brave. Challenge them. ”  King  King  cleared his throat . He drew  himself up to his full height a nd yelled in   a voice that  made the trees tremble.   “I AM THE KING OF THE KILLERS, AND I CHALLENGE YOU  TO A  RACE !”       Spinechilla and Titan turned their fearsome heads towards him.   “CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! ” they both roared.   “Now  what?” King K ing asked Lila in a whisper .  Lila glanced at the approaching dinosaurs. She was so small and weak that they  took no notice of her. They were only interested in King King.   “Tell them you want to rac e up to that line of  trees, ” she said.  “You h ave to r un  in and out of them , and then back here again.”   “Why?” asked King King.   “Just do it .”  So King King roared out the challenge.   “A race through the trees? That’s easy!” sneered Titan.   “Far too easy!”  hissed Spinechilla. “Start us off, and watch me  win!”   All three dinosaurs lined up , ready to start  the race . King King felt quite nervous.   8 “Oh no, you’re not,” snarled  Spinechilla, thundering  up after him . Titan came  poundin g along behind .   “I am! ” cried King King. “ I won the challenge!”   “It’s best of three,” Spinechilla  said.   “Best of three?”   “That’s only fair . Whoever fails the next challenge  is out! Then that will just  leave two of us!”  she hissed.   “What is the second challenge?” Titan  asked .  “Um…” King King bent down and pretended to scratch his foot, so that Lila  could whisper in his ear.       “Biting, ” Lila told him.  “The next challenge is to bite through one of those  thick  branches lying on the ground .”  King King looked at the huge logs in dismay .  He wasn’t sure if he was that  strong.   9 “You can do it,” Lila said encouragingly.   King King gulped. But he coul dn’t think of a better challenge, so he told the  other s, “You have to bite right through one of those  branches!”   “Easy!” snarled Spinechilla . She marched over to the branches,  grabbed the  biggest one and CRUNCHED .   Splinters flew through the air .  Spinechi lla spat out the minced -up bits of wood   and glared at King King. “Your turn.”   “Er – easy!” said King King. He  seized a branch and munched with all his might.   His jaws ached. His teeth hurt. But he just managed to b ite his branch in two.          “Hmph,” snorte d Spinechilla. “All right . Titan , you go next .”  “Easy! ” Titan  growled, as he  took hold of a branch  and shook it in his teeth .   10 Although his jaws wer e huge, they were not as strong as they looked . Lila knew  this. So she was not surprised when Titan dropped the branch without biting through  it.  “Hah! Loser !” sneered Spinechilla. “ I won that challenge. Now run  away , little  Titan,  before I crunch you up!”  She charged at Titan , who squealed in alarm.  He turned and crashed off through  the trees .          Spinechilla grinned at King King, showing all her cruel teeth .  “Just two of us left now ,” she said. “Time for the last  challenge. ”  “All right,” said King King. “The challenge is –”   “Oh, no, you don’t ! It’s my turn to  choose!  And I challenge you to swim across  the lake !”  11 Chapter Three       “Well?” hissed  Spinechilla. “Do you accept, or shall I just bite you in half like a  dead twig?”      “I accept!” squawked King King, terrif ied. Then he slumped to the ground in  despair.   “Oh, help! I’ve never swum before,” he groaned. “ Do you think  I can swim? ”  “No, I don’t ,” said Lila.  “Then I’m doomed! ”  “You’re not doomed . Get Spinechilla to go first.”   “Good idea! ” King K ing looked more  hopeful. “ While she’s in the water , I can  run away.”   “Certainly  not!” said Lila  sternly . “I thought you  wanted to be King of the  Killers? Y ou mustn’t  run away. What you need to do is this.”  Once again, she  whispered in his ear.   “Really?” said King King , looking puzzled .   “Really ,” Lila said.   Spinechilla plunged  into the lake  to start her swim.   12 As she set off, King King  began to swing his head from side to side. He wailed  and moan ed, just as Lila had told him .   “Oh, I’m so hungry! ” he whined. “ Oh, I’m starving! It’s way p ast my  dinnertime. I wish I had  a nice plump plesiosaur  to eat!”   “Quiet while I’m swimm ing!” snapped  Spinechilla ; but King King kept on  wailing  about his empty stomach.   “I could eat a hundred fine fat fish! I’m longing for a juicy ichthyosaur!” He kept  it up until she was too far acro ss the lake to hear him .  Then, at last,  he stopped.   “This is useless,” he grumbled to Lila. “Why did you tell me to say all that  about  being hungry ? It’s not doing any good.  Look how fast she ’s swimming !” For  Spinechilla was already halfway to the other side.   “Watch,” said Lila.   King King stared. Spinechilla wa s slow ing down. She began to swim round and  round in circles , snapping at the water with her vicious teeth.       “What’s she doing?” he asked.   “She’s hunting,” Lila said.   Fish were leaping o ut of the water all around Spinechilla , trying to escape . As  the fi sh fled, she followed them, snapping at their tails and gulping them down   whole .  13 Lila turned to King King. “You  put the idea of food into her head – and there’s  no room in there for more than one idea, ” she said. “By the time she gets across the  lake, she’ ll be full of fish . She’ll have forgotten all about the challenge. ”  Moment s later they saw Spinechilla cl imb out of the far side of the lake. She  waddled heavily to the bank and at once lay down to sleep . Her  stomach was  bulging.   “Well, I never! ” said King  King, amazed. “ I was sure she ’d win. She’s so big   and strong !”  “Spinechilla ’s very big indeed, ” agreed  Lila, “ except for her brain  – which is  tiny. And so is her memory.  I’m afr aid all you big fierce dinosaurs ha ve very tiny  memories. ”      “Not me!” said K ing King, lashing  his tail indignantly.   “So do you remember what the challenge  was all  about?”   “Um...”   14 “You are now officially King of the Killers,”  Lila said. “And because I helped  you beat the other dinosaurs, my family are safe from you for ever. Can yo u  remember that? ”  “Of course I can!” huffed  King King.  “Though I wouldn’t bother eating a  scrawny scrap  like you in any case.”  “Good.”   “Let’s face it,” he said loftily , “I’m the King  of the Killers , and y ou’re just a  tiny, helpless little – little – what e xactly are you?”   “A tuatara,” Lila said.   “A funny little tuatara! Ha  ha! Well, I won’t eat you. I don’t suppose you’ll last  long anyway , with all the se huge and hungry dinosaurs around !

Why-Cant-We-Glow-Like-Fireflies-FKB-Stories.txt,"Fireflies are small winged insects that glow in the dark but why do they shine and what creates this spark within them?  They’re bright and twinkling like little stars! I wish I could have glowed like them but I can’t! Can anyone tell me why?Imagine a dark, moonless night when you have gone camping with your classmates and you lose your way. What would you do? Will you not try contacting your friends by flashing your torchlight?Well, fireflies or ‘lightning bugs’ as they are sometimes called do the same, except that they have an unlimited supply of light within themselves! That is why fireflies never worry about fused light bulbs or electricity tariffs. They seem immensely happy just flying around and glowing- this is their signal to say, “Hey, look! I’m here!”The glow of the firefly is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferin. Proteins are special food used by our bodies to create muscles, bones and skin while pigments are natural colouring substances found in plants and animals. When these two meet inside the tiny belly of the firefly, they react with the oxygen already found in there.A celebration takes place, a soft firework display, so to say and bright light is produced which is the ‘glow’ of the firefly!  Fireflies therefore are bio- luminescent but they are not the only ones. Different types of fish and marine creatures in the sea also produce their own lights!The glow of the firefly functions like a light switch and is periodically turned on and off by the insect. It does this by sending a special ‘message’ from its brain to the ‘light organ’ inside its body that is its abdomen and soon the chemical reaction begins and the glow is produced!The grown up fireflies use their ‘glow’ to call out to their mates. In fact, female fireflies prefer ‘flashy males’ that can blink the longest or at a faster pace.  Once they see this special glow, the females respond to it by switching on their own lights. The firefly-mates soon meet and baby fireflies get created!The younger fireflies or the larvae, unlike their parents, use their glow mainly to chase predators away. The chemicals within their bodies are toxic and have a horrible taste so creatures that come to feast on them get put off and go hunting elsewhere for tastier munchies!Fireflies are never actually alone! There are more than 2,000 species of fireflies on this earth. During springtime, especially on dark nights, you may spot a few of them flitting around brightly!  Fireflies maybe tiny, smaller than your fingers perhaps, but grouped together, these glowing insects can light up an entire garden and all for free!  Sounds incredible, doesn’t it?Amazing facts about fireflies 1.  Fireflies are not flies but beetles! They are often called ‘lightning bugs’ but they aren’t bugs either. 2.  Different species of fireflies glow in different colors that range from yellow to green. Fireflies that flit around in the dark emit a greenish glow while those found outdoors during twilight give out a yellowish light..  There are a few non-vegetarian fireflies that feed on mites and other fireflies! 4.  Adult fireflies aren’t the only ones that glow, their eggs and larvae glow as well! If you tap a firefly’s egg, it flashes in response to your touch. 5.  Fireflies live in all continents except Antarctica. They love tropical climate but also thrive in temperate zones. They flit around forests, meadows and gardens during summer everywhere except in Antarctica that is much too cold for them.Do It Yourself 1.  Find out what else glows in the dark. Both, living and non-living. 2.  While playing in a group, imagine yourselves as fireflies. Carry a small torch in your hand and make different formations like fireflies..  Make a firefly with trash. For example, with a plastic bottle and glow stick. You can also try your own special ideas.This is a Level 3 book for children who are ready to read on their own.

Tanias-Discovery-FKB-Stories.txt,"Tania's Discovery Tania was helping mama with her gardening. Mama wanted to grow some tomatoes. She had already got the seeds and the pot. But she needed some mud. Tania offered to get her the mud. The housing society had a small little garden.Mama had talked to the society gardener, and he had told her that she could get some mud from the muddy patch near the swing. Tania went there with her bucket and spade in the evening to get some mudfor mama. She met Tanisha on her way and Tanisha offered to help her. Tania and Tanisha settled down with the bucket and spade near the muddy patch but the mud was too hard and dry. There was very little loose mud. They managed to scoop a couple of spades full but that would not be enough. They wondered what to do. Tania noticed a tap at the corner of the garden. That iswhere the gardener would connect the hose to water the garden. Tania and Tanisha walked over to the tap and filled their bucket with water. Then they brought the water back to the muddy patch and wet it thoroughly to make the mud soft. But they realised they had nothing to dig with. Tania had only brought her spade and no fork, because she had expected the mud to be loose.Tanisha suggested they look for some sticks in the clump of trees behind the swing. The 2 girls found a couple of nice sturdy sticks. Rather pleased with themselves, they made their way back to the wet muddy patch. Tania and Tanisha started digging busily. As they dug away they chatted, gossiped and joked about this and that. Soon they had dug up abig pile of mud. Tania and Tanisha looked at the mud pile and decided they had enough to fill the bucket. They were just about to stop digging and even up the hole when Tania noticed something odd. The bottom of the hole was shinning red. Tania touched it and it felt smooth like plastic. Tanisha and Tania got curious and dug some more. What could be there? With their curiosity aroused Tania and Tanisha dug efficiently and cleared away the mud rapidly, to reveal a red plastic box.The box was a little stuck but Tania and Tanisha managed to pull it out together sweating and panting. They were amazed at what they had found and could not wait to open it. On the count of three they flipped open the cover together andname there on the paper. And this is a picture from when she was about 4 years old in 2009! I wonder what this is all about."" ""We could ask her"", said Tania. They rushed over with the box to Tanisha's house. Trisha was surprised to see Tania and Tanisha so excited and she was even more surprised to see what they were holding. She recognised the red plastic box immediately, though it had been years since she had thought of it. Tania and Tanisha were bubbling with questions and Trisha tried to answer them all. She said ""The box is a time capsule. The four of us were best friends. We still are. We decided to document things that were important to us then, like our favourite candy, songs, books and what we wanted to be when we grew up. Then in 10 years we would check it out to see how much we had changed. It was buried in a boxunder the swing. We were supposed to open it on 18 th  May 2019."" She smiled nostalgically. ""Oh! I am sorry"" said Tania. ""We can bury it back."" ""No, no. Don't worry about that. Why don't you make a time capsule of your own instead and bury it in the same spot. My friends and I can take a look at this now. It will be fun. Then you can see if some nosy kids go dig up your time capsule before you intended for it to be dug up."" She winked at them and smiled. Tania and Tanisha returned to the garden. They picked up the bucket of mud to give Tania's mother. On the way up they excitedly discussed what they could put in their own time capsule.","Tania and her friend Tanisha were trying to get some mud for Tania's mother's gardening. After wetting the dry mud with water, they dug a hole and found a red plastic box buried beneath. The box turned out to be a time capsule made by Tania's sister and her friends when they were children, and they were supposed to open it in 2019. Tania's sister explained the concept of a time capsule to the girls, and suggested they make their own time capsule. Tania and Tanisha discussed what they could put in their own time capsule and left, excited about the idea.","['tania', 'tanisha', 'mud', 'muddy', 'scoop']"

Tania-Plays-a-Trick-FKB-Stories.txt,"Tania Plays A Trick Tania and Tanisha were on their way up to Tanisha's house. Mama had given them a book to give Tanisha's mother. The book had a recipe for a fruit cake that Tanisha had enjoyed eating in Tania's house. The girls were talking about the delicious fruit cake as they waited for the elevator on the 3 rd  floor in front of Tania's house.The elevator finally arrived. Tanisha's house was on the 10 th  floor. The girls entered the elevator and pressed the button labeled ""10"". What they did not notice, while they were chatting with each other, was that for some reason the button labeled ""8"" was pressed too. Someone had probably pressed it by mistake when the elevator was on its way down before.When the elevator stopped on the 8th floor the girls exited assuming it was the 10th floor. Tanisha's house was the first apartment on the left coming out of the elevator. So they rang the door bell of the first apartment on the left. But as soon as they rang the bell they realised something was wrong! The door looked quite different from Tanisha's door.As they looked around, for the first time they noticed the big ""8"" painted on the wall in between the two elevators indicating they were on the 8 th  floor. They realised they had rung Mrs. Wadia's doorbell by mistake. Oh, oh!Mrs. Wadia was a crochety old lady the children were terrified of. Tania and Tanisha panicked and hid in the stairwell. As they peeked from their hiding place, they saw Mrs. Wadia answer the door. She saw no one there. She called out saying ""Hello,  hello , who rang the bell?"", and then she mumbledsomething and returned assuming she had imagined the doorbell ringing. Tania and Tanisha found the whole thing quite funny from the sanctuary of their hiding place. They giggled as they took the stairs up for the remaining two floors. Somehow they were quite sure their mothers would not find their story funny so they decided to keep it tothemselves. Now that would have been the end of the story but the girls were too thrilled with the success of their unintentional trick. So the next time she yelled at them for playing in the building lobby, they decided it was time to trick her again. Their trick worked well the second time too and they enjoyed how harassed Mrs. Wadia looked answering the door only to find nobody there.Tania and Tanisha should have known that the secret to a good trick is to know when to stop using it. If you repeat it too often, you will get caught. The next time they used the trick Mrs. Wadia was in a very bad mood. She also began to smell a rat. She rushed out with her walking stick and searched the place. It did not take her long to find the two culprits in the stairwell. She was very angry. She asked Tania and Tanisha for their phone numbers. They blubbered out their phone numbers in fright. She promptly called the parents of bothgirls and told them that the girls had been harassing her for a few days. Mama was shocked. Tania was rarely so inconsiderate. Tania came home looking scared. Mama looked very disappointed. She asked, ""Tania why did you play the nasty trick on Mrs. Wadia?"" Tania told her the whole story from the beginning when they rang Mrs. Wadia's bell by mistake. Then Tania added ""Mama, she is such a mean old lady. She is always shouting at us and waving her scary stick. She shouts at us for playing in the buildinglobby even when it is raining, or if the ball rolls out of the children's play area, or if we occasionally pluck a flower or any little thing. So we wanted to trouble her too."" Mama said ""Tania, when Mrs. Wadia was younger she had an accident and her leg was hurt. That is why she needs to use a walking stick. Although the doctors could fix it so she can walk, her leg still hurts. It has been hurting her all day everyday for the last 10 years. Don't you think that it is a good enough reason to make anyone a grumpy person? It is very mean to make her walk to the door for nothing when her leg hurts so much."" Tania looked very troubled. She said ""Mama, I did not know she was in so much pain. I thought she carried the walking stick to frighten us."" Mama's lips twitched a little but she listened as Tania continued, ""I will call her andapologise again and the next time I get a chocolate I'll go give it to her to make it up to her for my mean trick."" Mama said ""That is the baby I know and love. I'll buy you 2 chocolates tomorrow and you can take one to Mrs. Wadia. And Tania please think very carefully before you do something mean again. We are all tempted to do mean things once in a while but it is almost never a good idea.""","Tania and Tanisha accidentally rang the doorbell of Mrs. Wadia, a grumpy old lady they were scared of, while trying to find Tanisha's apartment. They thought it was funny and repeated the trick of ringing her doorbell without anyone being there. However, Mrs. Wadia eventually caught them and called their parents, making Tania realize that her mean trick was hurtful to someone in pain. Tania apologized to Mrs. Wadia and learned to be more considerate of others.","['tanisha', 'tania', 'elevator', 'elevators', 'door']"

See  if  you    can  tell  which  shark  is  a  hammerhead   shark,  which  is  a  tiger  shark  and  which   is  a  great  white  shark.Sharks  come  in  all  different  sizes.  The   whale  shark  is  the  biggest  fish  in  the   world.  It  can  grow  to  be  45  feet  long.Other  sharks  can  be  small,  like  this   little  leopard  shark.  The  smallest  sharks    are  only  seven  inches  long.Some  sharks  are   born  live  but    others  hatch  from   an  egg  case,  like   the  one  in  this   picture.      Can  you  see  its   head,  tail  and   fins?Baby  sharks  are  called  pups.  A  mother   shark  doesn’t  take  care  of  her  babies    after  they  are  born,  they  have  to  take   care  of  themselves.Sharks  are  deadly   predators,  which   means  that  they   hunt  and  eat  other   animals  like  fish,   seals  and  even   other  sharks.    Great  white  sharks   eat  five  hundred   pounds  of  meat   every  day!Sharks  catch  their  prey  with  their  sharp   teeth.  When  sharks  lose  teeth,  new  ones   grow.  They  have  at  least  four  layers  of   pointy  teeth.Sharks  have  a   good  sense  of   smell  and  can    follow  the  smell    of  blood  from  up   to  a  mile  away.         Sharks  can  see   about  as  well  as  people.  They  hear   sounds  underwater   from  miles  away.The  only  animals  that  hunt  sharks  are  other   sharks  and  people.  People  catch  sharks  for   food  like  the  shark  steaks  in  this  picture.The  best  place  to   see  a  shark  is  at   an  aquarium.

Sharks have been around for over 200 million years and come in various shapes and sizes, from the giant whale shark to the small leopard shark. Some sharks are born live while others hatch from eggs, and baby sharks are called pups. Sharks are predators that eat other animals like fish, seals, and even other sharks. They catch their prey with their sharp teeth and have a good sense of smell and hearing. Humans catch sharks for food and other purposes, and the best place to see a shark is at an aquarium where visitors may even get to pet one.","['shark', 'sharks', 'whale', 'fish', 'animals']"
FKB-Kids-Stories-Tania-Loses-a-Tooth.txt,"Tania Loses A Tooth Tania had just woken up. She was in the bathroom, groggily brushing her teeth. Suddenly something frightened her.  Her front tooth was shaking . Was it real? Or was it a bad dream? She pinched herself. Ouch! She was definitely awake. That pinch really hurt. Then why was the tooth shaking? Tania quickly rinsed her mouth and ran out of the bathroom screaming in fright.Mama was making breakfast in the kitchen; scrambled eggs with black olives and tomatoes. Papa was toasting brown bread. Mama and papa were both startled to hear Tania shouting "" Mama, papa, my tooth is shaking. Help! I think it is going to come out. What do I do? """"Oh that!"" said papa a little annoyed, picking up a toast he had dropped. Mama said ""Don't worry Tania. It is perfectly normal. The teeth you have now are baby teeth. They usually start falling out at age 5 or 6 years."" ""Oh! said Tania still looking scared. ""What happens then? Does it hurt when it falls out?"" ""Not really."" said mama casually. ""The tooth will shake for sometime and then when it becomes very loose it will fall out. Don't worry about it honey. It is all quite normal. We can talk more about teeth this afternoon when you are back from school."" Mama's calm attitude comforted Tania and she left for school.In the school bus Tania was absent-mindedly pushing at the lose tooth with her tongue . Tanisha asked ""Tania, why are you making weird faces?"" Tania then realised what she was doing and told Tanisha about her lose tooth. Tanisha said ""Oh yeah! Trisha lost one of her back teeth last year. I guess I'll lose one soon too. Does it hurt?"" ""No. Look I can waggle it with my tongue and it doesn't hurt at all."" Tania was the first in her class to have a lose tooth. She enjoyed waggling it and showing it to her friends. It looked so scary but it did not hurt at all. What fun!In the afternoon mama was ready with pictures to explain to Tania what was going on with her teeth. She said ""Your first tooth came out when you were 9 months old. By the time you were 3 years old you had all your baby teeth."" ""It took more than 2 years to grow all my teeth! That is a long time."" ""Yes honey. The first tooth to grow is usually one of these 4 front teeth. They are called the central incisors. The first tooth you had was this front one on the bottom. Seems like it is going to be the first to fall off too."" Mama smiled and continued. ""These 4 teeth right next to the front 4 are called lateral incisors. Lateral means to the side. All the incisors are used to bite. They are the teeth you use to bite in to an apple for example.""The pointed teeth on the sides of your mouth,right next to the incisors are the canines. Tania felt her canines with her fingers and said, ""Aren't those the huge teeth that Kazoo has?"" ""Yes, that is correct! Kazoo does have huge canines. Most carnivorous animals like cats, tigers and  lions  have large canines. Large canines are useful to tear flesh and meat.""""The last two teeth behind your canines are your molars. They are for chewing and grinding your food."" Tania was making a very weird face so mama asked ""Tania what are you doing? You look weird"" ""Oh! I am just using my tongue to count my teeth, mama. Every type of tooth you mentioned is there, and the correct number of them too. Yet when I count them all, there are only 20. I thought humans have 32 teeth. I am confused.""""Wow Tania! You are well informed. Yes adult humans do have 32 teeth. After your molars fall off they will be replaced by teeth called premolars. Then 3 more molars will grow behind the premolars. You will get those molars later when you grow up and your mouth is large enough to accommodate them.The last molar right at the back of the mouth is called a wisdom tooth, because you are supposed to be wise by the time you have it. The 4 wisdom teeth appear much later, usually after the age of 17. Many people get only a few of the wisdom teeth. So most adults have between 28 and 32 teeth. The next day was Saturday and Tania was visiting her grandparents in the evening. Tania showed grandma and grandpa her shaking tooth. Grandpa said, ""Tania, we can tie one end of a thread to that lose tooth and the other end to the door knob. Then we can slam the door shut and your tooth will come off. Then it wont bother you any more.""Tania looked at the door in horror and pleaded, ""Grandpa, please don't do that. The tooth doesn't bother me. Mama said it would eventually get quite loose and fall off."" Grandpa did not mean to frighten Tania. He said, ""Don't worry. We don't have to do it unless you want to. We can wait for it to fall off. There is no rush. But it really doesn't hurt much. That is how I took off my first shaking tooth."" Tania looked at grandpa in awe. He really mustbe very brave she thought. Grandpa saw how unhappy Tania was with the idea. So he changed the subject. He asked, ""Tania, do you know about the tooth fairy."" ""No"", said Tania. ""Who is the tooth fairy?"" Grandpa said ""Didn't mama tell you? The tooth fairy collects fallen baby teeth. Nobody knows what she needs them for, but she pays well for them. So when that tooth of yours falls out, you should put it under your pillow. Then while you are asleep the tooth fairy will take the tooth and give you a little gift inreturn."" ""Oh! Is she like a Santa Claus who collects teeth?"" asked Tania excited. ""Yes I suppose she is."" said grandpa. Just then grandma announced dinner. The delicious aroma of chana masala was wafting through the air. Tania forgot all about her tooth. She enjoyed her meal of rice, chana masala and palak paneer with great relish. After dinner grandpa offered Tania a toffee. He always gave her a sweet treat after dinner and Tania always looked forward to it. Tania took the toffee and sucked it for some time. Then she bit into it and  while chewing it she felt something hard in the toffee. She took itout of her mouth to take a look and to her great surprise, she found her own tooth stuck in the toffee! Tania smiled. She had been so worried about having to tug out the tooth when grandpa told her about threads and doorknobs. But the tooth came off so painlessly that Tania did not even realise it was out. Grandpa helped Tania clean the sticky toffee off the tooth. He then wrapped it up in some cotton and gave it to Tania. Mama, papa and Sonia came to pick up Tania soon after. She told them the amazing story of how her tooth came out. On the ride back home she asked mama about the tooth fairy. Mama said ""Yes Tania. There is a tooth fairy. You should put your tooth under your pillow tonight and see what she gives you.""The next morning Tania found a brand new box of water colours under her pillow. Awesome! Now, she cant wait for her next tooth to fall. The tooth fairy is a generous soul, don't you think?","The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a novel by Mark Twain that tells the story of Tom Sawyer, a mischievous and adventurous boy living in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, in the mid-19th century.

Domino-Goes-to-the-Beach-R-FKB-Kids-Stories.txt,"This story is dedicated to Domino, who has provided us with years of   companionship and love.Domino is a Boston Terrier.  She likes to play with her toys and enjoys her family. Domino sat one Tuesday, looking so sad.   She wanted something exciting to do, but it was too cold outside. We asked Domino if she would like to go to the beach to visit Alex.   She was so excited! Alex was Domino's human brother who moved far away to a beautiful town on the   coast of New Jersey. We traveled many hours in the car. Domino was very good and sat patiently in her   seat. We made frequent stops at doggie friendly areas. On the way to the hotel, we stopped and surprised Alex. He had no idea that   Domino was coming to visit him. When we arrived at the hotel, Domino was a little nervous, but happy to be out of   the car so she could stretch her legs. The sand was soft on Domino's paws and there were so many new scents.  The waves came up and got her feet wet. She didn't like that very much and made   certain to not get too close the the ocean. Domino saw lots of things that she had never seen before.   The gulls were quite odd to Domino. The noise they made sounded like laughter.   What funny birds. Nothing like the small birds at home. Afterward, Domino needed a nap as she was so tired from her busy day. The next day Domino went sight-seeing at a nearby town.  It was a nice walk through the streets lined with quaint shops.      Domino went on the boardwalk. Dogs usually aren't allowed on the boardwalk,   but since it was the off-season there were only a few people so no one minded that   she was there. She stopped so some little girls could visit with her. Domino had a few bites of peanut butter frozen custard, yum!!!    Domino saw some huge concrete beach balls.  They wouldn't roll or bounce so they weren't too much fun for dogs to play with.        We went metal detecting on the beach. I bet domino hoped that we would   findsome dog bones buried in the sand, but we only found a few old metal bottle   caps. We threw them in the trash because we want to make sure the beaches are   clean and free of trash that can cut our feet or paws.      She took a nap with Alex. I bet Domino had sweet dreams of the birds laughing   as the cool waves covered her paws or the sweet taste of frozen custard or how nice   it was to visit with him.     We left for the long ride back home with fond memories of all of the fun   adventures that we shared.   We look forward for another vacation adventure with   our furry family member, Domino. Good bye, Jersey Shore. We hope to come back soon! Woof, woof! Here are some tips if you want to take your pet on vacation: Make reservations at a pet friendly hotel a head of time. Sometimes there are special rules   and extra charges for pets. Never leave your pet in a car alone where they might become over heated or afraid. It is your responsibility to clean up after your pet. Make sure that you have everything that you need to make your pet feel at home while   traveling. Make frequent stops so your dog can stretch. Have water that your pet can sip on. Have your pet vaccinations and license up to date and available. Choose a location where your pet won't spending the whole trip in the hotel room. That   won't be a fun vacation for them at all. Keep your pet on a leash to avoid accidents or confrontations with people that may not   care for animals. Talk to your veterinarian before your trip. Look on the internet for ideas on things to do and local regulations for pets.","The story is about a Boston Terrier named Domino who goes on a vacation to visit her human brother, Alex, who lives on the coast of New Jersey.

She would follow the narrow paths through the  fields, crossing rivers as she went.Wangari was a clever child and couldn’t wait to  go to school. But her mother and father wanted her to stay and help them at home.  When she was seven years old, her big brother  persuaded her parents to let her go to school.She liked to learn!

She wanted  to know more about the world.At the American university Wangari learnt  many new things. She studied plants and how they grow. And she remembered how she grew:  playing games with her brothers in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Kenyan forests. The more she learnt, the more she realised that  she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted them to be happy and free.  The more she learnt, the more she remembered  her African home.When she had finished her studies, she returned  to Kenya. But her country had changed. Huge farms stretched across the land.  Women had no wood to make cooking fires.  The people were poor and the children were hungry.Wangari knew what to do. She taught the  women how to plant trees from seeds.  The women sold the trees and used the money  to look after their families.  The women were very happy. Wangari had  helped them to feel powerful and strong.

Minny-Wants-a-Ride-FKB-Stories.txt,"Grandpa Gomes smiled. “Of course little Minny, but tell me, why do you want to use a wheel-chair.   You have not two, but four healthy legs?” “Why, Minny?” asked Grandma Gomes who had so much pain in her knees that it brought tears to   her eyes. “Why, lazy Minny?” asked Guppu, who had broken his leg while playing in school. “Why, Minny dear?” asked Jhumpa, who never tired of running errands for everyone in the village. Minny thought about it. She could not say she wanted to use the chair just for a lark. Or just   because she felt tired. Or just because she was too lazy. Or just because she was getting fat. “Oh, I really want to give Laila company when she goes to school. She gets so sad watching other   children run or skip to school, you know,” said Minny with an expression of concern. Grandpa Gomes agreed. “Fine, Minny, so you can go to school with Laila in her wheel-chair today.” The world looked beautiful from where Minny sat on Laila's lap. The snow on faraway hills, the   birds on the trees, and the shower of blossoms under the trees made Minny smile like a Cheshire   cat. Minny saw Uncle Ali taking Mona piggy-back to school. Mona had hurt her toe, and could not   walk easily.  The wheel-chair rumbled uphill, causing Minny's back quite some strain. Then when Laila pushed   the wheel-chair downhill, Minny's eyes grew wide with worry. Would they tumble down and hurt   her lovely tail, she wondered. Then when the wheel-chair came to a river, Minny nearly jumped off!   “I can't get wet! I...I...I'm going right back!” she squealed. “Don't worry, I'll ferry you across,” said   Kinchuk, the school's top sportsperson.  “I should really build my stamina,” thought Minny, looking at how strong and helpful Kinchuk was. The school seemed  really far, far, far away. On the  way, Minny saw a lot of people working. She   saw old people digging the land to make roads. She saw young people cutting stones to lay paths.  She realised how difficult it was for Laila to get to school. And she realised that Laila always   looked so much at ease, and so happy. No wonder everyone wanted to help her! Soon Minny was full of remorse. She really was the laziest, vainest, sourest, thoughtless, selfish   living being in all of Gompaguri, she thought. She whined, and she purred , and she screeched so   much that she was surprised people hadn't thrown her into the Psering River till now! “I must change,” thought Minny. “I must be a new cat henceforth,” she continued to think.  Minny tried her best to be a hardworking, modest, pleasant, thoughtful,  unselfish living being like   all the others in Gompaguri.  Some days later she climbed up Grandpa Gomes' roof to see....well,   she had some work. There she got stuck, and couldn't climb down. She tried several times, but   decided finally that she needed help.  Remember, Minny was a changed cat. She did not whine. She did not purr loudly. She did not   screech. Instead she did what the lovely people of Gompaguri did when they worked. She sang. And   very loudly! She sang out calling for help.  All of Gompaguri heard her. They all came out to help, as they always did. “Dear Minny, you really are a silly-billy. Do try not to get stuck like this, but if you do get stuck,   promise us you'll never sing....cats MUST purr, and you purr so much better than you sing! Minny walked away gracefully with her head and tail held high , even as all the children laughed at   her affectionately. ","The story is about a lazy and selfish cat named Minny who wants to use a wheel-chair to go to school with her friend Laila, who is unable to walk. Minny's family and friends question her about why she wants to use a wheelchair when she has four healthy legs. However, they eventually agree to let her use it to accompany Laila to school. During their journey, Minny realizes how difficult it is for Laila to get to school and how much help she receives from the people in their village. She starts to feel remorseful and decides to change her ways. Later on, when she gets stuck on Grandpa Gomes' roof, she calls for help by singing, and everyone in the village comes to her aid.

She was a friend of the children, and she was afriend of the teachers.The little girl wondered if Didi knew any stories. She went up to Didi shyly. ""Do you have a fewminutes? Can you tell me a story?"" Didi looked at the little girl very seriously. ""Ofcourse,"" she said.""I can tell you a story. What kind of story would youlike?"" The little girl’s eyes grew big with anticipation. ""Canyou tell me a story about a lion?""Didi sat down in the verandah ofthe school, and started telling thelittle girl a story about a smalllion who was lost in the jungle. The little girl sat still and listenedintently.Didi’s story was so vivid that shecould feel the wind through thebranches of the huge trees in thejungle, the soft swaying soundsof the tall grass, and the velvetyfur of the small cub.The little girl’s friends who were playing nearby came to find out what Didi was saying.Soon, they were absorbed in the tale too.Before long, the little girl’s entireclass was around them, listeningand imagining, and demandingmore stories. The little girl, her friends and theteachers soon found out that Didiknew lots and lots of stories.She could tell stories about monkeys and birds, about ferocious dogs and mean cats, about fish in blue rivers and deep oceans, about high mountains and green valleys, about children in big cities and children in small villages, about adventures and mysteries, about handsome kings and lovely queens, about what to do when you were scared, and what to do when you were sad, about finding lost treasures, and about knowing wonderful secrets, and much much more.Everyday the little girl and her friends sat with Didi. Children from other classes came. The teachers of the school came. Children from neighbouring schools came. Children who were not in school came. Children who had left school came. Children who were too young to go to school came.Some sat and listened. Some stood and listened.The youngest children lay down on their stomachs, cupping their faces in their hands, and listened. As they listened, they learned how to tell stories to each other.They learned how to buildstories, how to spin stories, howto weave stories, how toembroider stories, how to cookstories and how to fly stories likekites in a big blue sky. They alllearned how to tell them so thatthe listeners could not blink ormove and would remainmesmerized till the story ended.Slowly, through Didi, the little girl, and the children, stories began to spread through thecity. People began to tell stories and people began to listen to stories.Mothers stopped work; fathers put away newspapers and teachers put aside thearithmetic textbooks; neighbours did not go shopping. They began to tell stories. The big brothers stopped playing cricket, and the little sistersstopped skipping rope. They began to listen to stories.The bhajiwala stopped selling bhaji. The doodhwala stopped delivering milk. The paanwala put aside all thepaan and supari. They all started listening to each other’s stories.The bus driver left his bus and came to listen. The conductor forgot his bag of tickets andmoney in the bus – he was in such a hurry to tell the passengers his stories. Trains did not run in the city, because the drivers were too busy with stories.Newspapers were not printed. Buildings could not be built, the flyovers could not becompleted.No restaurants served pau-bhaji, no bhelwala made bhel-puri.  No fisherman went out tofish. No one was willing to do anything but tell stories and listen to stories.The postmen did not deliver letters because they were busy with stories.The policeman sat in the middle of the busy intersection telling stories to all the drivers around him. All thetelevisions in the city were switched off because people were listening to stories.The entire city came to acomplete halt. The Mayor of thecity was worried. ""What is to be done now?"" hesaid to his Council of Ministers ashe paced up and down the bigroom, in the Mayor’s mansion bythe sea. ""No one is working, andnothing is happening in thecity.""The Council of Ministers worked feverishly making plans and strategies. But nothing worked, no onelistened.Finally, Didi and the little girl were summoned to the Mayor’s mansion by the sea. TheCouncil of Ministers had been told that these two had flooded the city with an ocean ofstories.The little girl looked very little in the large room with high ceilings and tall pillars. Sheheld on to Didi’s hand tightly.Didi too looked small, surrounded by the fat and tall men and women of the Council ofMinisters. No one smiled.

Tania-at-School-FKB-Stories.txt,"Tania At School It was over a year since Tania's 4 th  birthday. Tania was 5 years old and in the second year of Kindergarten. She loved going to school. It was a small preschool with 15 children in the class. The school had a very smart and cute uniform. The girls wore a navy blue skirt and a white blouse with a navy blue collar.Tania and her friends Tanisha and Sonali were all in the same class. The shiny yellow school bus picked them up at the gate to  the housing society at 8:15 a.m. School started at sharp 9:00 a.m. every weekdaymorning. A pleasant sounding bell announced the beginning of the first class. The first class was creative thinking, followed by reading and writing. Then there was a break for a mid morning snack. After that there was singing, followed by art. Thenafter another short break the children gathered together for story time before leaving for home. Tania enjoyed all her classes and art was her favourite. Occasionally the teacher gave them a fun homework assignment. Tania was very conscientious about doing her best at all the homework assignments. Mama was very proud of her and her teachers were very fond of her. They admired her dedication. There was just one thing about Tania that irked her teachers. She was very talkative in class. Sometimes she would miss out what the teacher said. But being very bright she was usually able to fill in the gaps herself.One Wednesday morning, Tania was waiting with Tanisha and Sonali for the school bus to arrive. Sonali said, ""I really enjoyed doing the homework assignment. Usually we only get art homework. It was nice to have a creative thinking assignment for a change."" ""Homework assignment! What assignment? Is it due today?"" said Tania sounding panicked.""Yes. Miss Gupta gave us an assignment 2 days ago. It is due today."" said Tanisha. ""Didn't you know?"" The school bus arrived and the girls got in. ""No!"" said Tania. ""What is the assignment? Tell me."" Tanisha replied, ""We have to come up with 5 unusual uses of an umbrella. I think you were chatting with Karishma at the end of the class and did not hear Miss Gupta give us the assignment.""""Tanisha please let me copy your assignment"" begged Tania. ""What!"" said Tanisha shocked. ""I can't believe you are saying that."" ""That is wrong Tania, and you know it"" said Sonali. ""Yes I do. I promise I wont ever ask you to do this again. But please just this once..."" said Tania crying.Tanisha and Sonali looked at each other and finally decided to help out Tania  just this once . Just then the bus reached school and the girls stepped out. It was only 8:30 am, and there was still half an hour before class started. Tania took out a clean sheet of paper and a beautifully sharpened pencil. She carefully copied all of Tanisha's homework. Tanisha had made a neatlist of the 5 entries. Tania finished copying just a few minutes before class started. She wrote her name at the back of the sheet of paper and turned it in.The next day Miss Gupta asked Tania and Tanisha to come and talk to her during the break. Tania felt worried and guilty. The two girls walked to the teacher's office together. Miss Gupta said ""Obviously one of you has copied the other's homework. Otherwise they would not be identical. Are you going to tell me who and why?""The guilt weighed Tania down and she confessed. She said ""Miss Gupta, I copied Tanisha's homework. I am so sorry."" ""But why dear? You usually do such a good job with your homework."" Tania turned red with embarrassment as she said, ""I did not hear you assign the homework Miss Gupta. Iwas talking to Karishma at the time. Sonali was talking about the assignment at the bus stop yesterday morning. That is when I found out about it. It was too late to do the assignment myself and I really wanted to submit my homework on time. So I copied Tanisha's. She protested but I pleaded with her and she gave in. This is not her fault at all."" ""I see"", said Miss Gupta. ""Tanisha why don't you go back to your break? I need to talk to Tania."" Tanisha heaved a sigh of relief and sprinted away. Miss Gupta continued ""Tania the whole point of the homework was to get you to think creatively. Turning it in on time is good but worthless if you just copied it. I would have been disappointed that you did not get it done on time, but when you mess up you should be brave enough to face the consequences. That is what makes you a strong and good person.""""Yes Miss Gupta"" said Tania meekly. ""I see your point and I promise I wont do it again. I am really very sorry."" ""Yes I can see you are truly sorry. Tania, I hope you also learned that it is not a good idea to be distracted and talking in class. That way you miss important things."" ""Yes Miss Gupta"" said Tania looking very ashamed and glum. ""We all make mistakes Tania. But as long as you learn from them you will do fine. Now cheer up and move on. It is time for your next class."" She smiled at Tania and Tania trotted off to her next class.","Tania is a 5-year-old girl in her second year of kindergarten.

Panicking, Tania begged her friends to let her copy their homework, and they eventually gave in. The next day, Tania and her friend Tanisha were called to speak with their teacher, Miss Gupta, who suspected that one of them had copied the other's homework. Tania confessed to copying Tanisha's homework and apologized, explaining that she had missed the assignment due to talking and wanted to submit her homework on time.

Here are a few ideas for engaging with children using visual stories: - Explore the story in a leisurely manner. Draw attention to the details - the expressions of the characters, setting, colours, etc. The idea is for each child to build her own story. If the story is being shown to a group of children, you could ask each of them to contribute a sentence or two for each illustration. Take joy in exploring each illustration and build the story as you go along. - Use themes explored in the story to start a discussion.

FKB-kids-stories-Piglet-gets-a-new-job.txt,"Piglet Gets A New Job Chapter 1: The Circus  The piglet did not get paid for her job, which was very unfair considering how  dangerous it was. She did get a certain satisfaction from carrying out her duties, but  this was not the main reason that she never once complained about her lack of pay.  The fact was that she had no idea about money. You might say that a more intelligent piglet would have figured it out by her age. Everyone who came to see the circus paid for their tickets in coins - silver or copper, depending on their circumstances. For the  circus folk, money, or rather the lack of it, was one of their favourite topics of  conversation. Certainly the man who fed the piglet never failed to mention money  during his visits to her.  ""You'll eat us out of house and home, you will,"" he said as he poured the slops into  the trough, but to the piglet this sounded no different to 'enjoy your meal' or 'bon  appetit'.  Thinking about it afterwards, with the benefit of old age and wisdom, the piglet  concluded that she had just not needed to know about money at that stage in her life.  She was fed daily. She had clean straw to sleep on. She had plenty of free time to  play with the circus children. In return, she allowed herself to be fired from a cannon  three times daily. Until one day.  It was their last show on the last day in a small place that they only visited once every year or two. Up until then, everything had gone as normal, and the piglet could not  think what she must have done in between the second and third shows in order to  have delivered such a dramatically different result. The lively crowd had watched  with expectation as the piglet was loaded into the cannon. For some, this was the  second or even third time that they had seen the performance, but even so their  attention never wandered. They closely followed each elaborate step in the process of preparing the cannon. The setting of the cannon. The checking of the safety net. The  fixing of the fuse. Finally the operator lit the fuse and ran for safety, tripping over –  as he always did – just before he made it to the little sandbag wall he had built in the  centre of the ring.  BOOM went the cannon. With their eyes, the audience followed the curved path that  the piglet ought to have taken through the air, between the cannon and the net. Right  on cue, the operator staggered to his feet. His face was blackened with soot, and he  wobbled about, knocking on his ears as if trying to get the ringing out of them. Then  he stopped. The audience was laughing, just as they always did, but this time there  was something wrong with the laughter. It was too loud and a little more ... cruel than usual. The operator looked at the net, and he was shocked to find that the piglet was  not there. Maybe she missed the net, he thought in panic. Maybe she's hurt. Then he  realised that the audience were all looking at the cannon. He turned that way too,  PagePiglet Gets A New Job slowly, not sure that he wanted to see. There was the piglet, halfway in and halfway  out of the cannon. Her front trotters thrashed wildly in the air as she tried to free  herself from this embarrassing prison, but it was no good and her squeals of distress  could be clearly heard, even above the laughter.  The operator ran to try and help her get out, while the ringmaster rushed forward to  distract the crowd.  ""Well, ladies and gentlemen, now I think we all understand the meaning of that  phrase 'squealing like a stuck pig'.""  Everybody laughed, and the ringmaster went on to introduce the next act. Meanwhile  the cannon, piglet and all, were quietly wheeled out of the tent.  It had taken a while to free the piglet. They had pulled, and she had wriggled. They  had poured oil onto her, and she had tried to suck in her tummy. Eventually she had  come unstuck with a little 'pop', and everyone had fallen, panting, to the grass. The  piglet was unharmed, apart from a red ring around her middle, and even this had gone by the time she woke up the next morning. In fact, even the memory of being stuck  had started to fade, so it was a bit of a surprise when the ringmaster turned up at her  sty. Even without his top hat and red jacket, the ringmaster was a figure to be  respected. The piglet could not remember any time when he had come to see her  before, and so she was quite terrified – especially as he was accompanied by a crowd  of circus folk.  ""So, little piglet,"" he said, looking down at her, ""it seems that you are too big to fire  from the cannon.""  The piglet suddenly felt that the situation had been caused by some wilful action on  her part and that getting larger was due to more than just the natural process of  getting older.  ""Well,"" continued the ringmaster, ""we don't have room in this circus for people who  can't pull their weight.""  He looked at the piglet. The piglet looked blankly back. ""Maybe you can juggle?""  suggested the ringmaster. The piglet shook her head. ""Or walk on two legs?"" The  ringmaster tried.  Again a shake of the head.  ""Is there nothing you can do to earn your keep?""  This time there was no shake of the head. Instead a single, solitary tear rolled down  the piglet's cheek and dropped onto the straw below.  ""She could make us a lovely lot of bacon rashers for our breakfast,"" called out the  clown.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job ""This piglet has been a member of the circus since she was born,"" said the ringmaster, ""and we all know that the circus is a family.""  He looked the clown in the eye as he continued slowly, pausing between each word.  ""We ... do ... not ... eat ... family!"" ""Why don't we sell her then,"" replied the clown,  cheekily.  ""I'll sell you, if you're not careful,"" snapped the ringmaster, the tone of his voice  making it clear that there were to be no further suggestions from the clown.  Unfortunately, nobody else could think of anything that the piglet could do in the  circus, now that she would no longer fit in the cannon. The ringmaster sighed a big  sigh and knelt down in order to speak to the piglet more directly. The other circus  folk began to drift away.  ""I'm afraid, my friend, that we circus people are not rich,"" he said, as if he were  revealing a great secret to the piglet alone, ""in fact, we are so poor that if we are not  all able to work – if one single member of our family were to stop contributing – the  whole circus would fall apart.""  He paused, to let the piglet imagine how terrible a thing that would be.  ""So you see how it must be? It’s time for us to go our separate ways. You do  understand, don't you?""  The piglet was suddenly aware that the circus had now been almost entirely  dismantled and packed up. She felt sad and frightened about being sent off alone. She also felt sure that in a real family you wouldn't be thrown out simply because you  were no longer useful. She almost said this to the ringmaster, but then she  remembered the clown. It seemed a good idea not to make the ringmaster angry, as he had just stopped her from being eaten, so she simply nodded.  ""That's the spirit,"" said the ringmaster.  He stood up and looked around. Seeing one of the acrobats nearby, he called out.  ""Billy, let's make sure this brave little pig gets a good meal before she starts her  journey.""  Then he thought of something else and bent down again.  ""You should remember that not all people are like us circus folk. There are many out  there who would do you harm. We’ll be heading to the next town.""  He pointed down the road.  ""You should head into the countryside.""  He pointed in the other direction.  ""Be sure to stick to the quieter tracks. Lose yourself in the woods and always –  PagePiglet Gets A New Job always – hide yourself from people.""  The ringmaster stood up, patted her on the head and started to walk away. There were so many questions running around in the piglet’s mind that she called out to stop him  – or she would have done if, at that moment, Billy hadn't arrived back and dumped a  big heap of apples and peelings in front of her. Hungrily the piglet tucked into the  food. She stopped eating only when she felt two little arms being flung around her  neck. It was one of the children, who gave her a big hug and then ran to join his  family on their caravan. The circus was now moving off in a long convoy of horse- drawn vehicles, and all that the piglet could do was stand and watch, as the only life  she had ever known disappeared into the distance. Suddenly she lost her appetite, lay  down on the ground and waited, unable to decide what to do next.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Chapter 2: The Wood  The piglet was woken by the sound of children's voices. Lazily she opened her eyes  and saw, a little way off, a group of boys and girls who had come from the nearby  village to search for anything the circus might have left behind. Because she was  small and lying still, the children had not seen her yet, and the words of the  ringmaster sounded in her head – “always, always, hide yourself from people”.  Slowly the piglet started to crawl away. Everything went well at first, but pigs are not built for stealth, and it wasn't long before one of the children spotted her.  ""Look! There's the little pig who got stuck in the cannon,"" he shouted.  Knowing that there was no more point trying to hide, the piglet jumped to her feet  and ran as fast as she could in the direction the ringmaster had pointed.  ""Get it!"" shouted one of the children.  The shout seemed so close behind her that the piglet felt a jolt of fear, which gave  extra strength to her legs, and she rocketed forwards. Once she reached the road, the  children, who were only half serious about the chase, gave up and returned to  searching the field. The piglet, however, did not stop and did not even look back until she was quite exhausted. Even then she still found the energy to hide herself in a  ditch by the road before she fell asleep.  When she woke, the day was drawing on, and she was feeling very hungry.  Unfortunately, this stretch of the road was crossing open grassland, and there wasn't  much that was good for pigs to eat. She tried nibbling on a bit of grass, but her teeth  weren't suited to the job - and it tasted awful. In the end, it got dark while she was  still searching, so she hid herself away from the road and went to sleep with a  rumbling tummy.  Over the next few days things got easier. Following the advice she had been given,  the piglet stuck to the quieter roads and tracks until she was about as far from any  village or town as it was possible to be. Here she found an enormous wood. There  was plenty to eat, lots of good places to hide and absolutely no people. The piglet  might have been quite happy living here for the rest of her life, except that she was  lonely. She missed the circus very much, and after only a few days, she had come up  with a plan that would allow her to go back. It was very simple really. All she needed to do was to develop a skill that would make her useful again. But what?  First she practised standing on two legs. It was very difficult to balance on her little  trotters, but she kept at it and worked hard until she could stand quite well, and even  take a few steps. This might have been enough to send any other piglet scurrying off  to catch up with the circus, but not this one. She had seen so many performances that  she knew every act had to be spectacular. A little pig walking on its hind legs was  PagePiglet Gets A New Job unusual, but certainly not what you would call spectacular. There had to be more. So  she taught herself how to juggle – with acorns. She wasn't bad, but she couldn't keep  going for long because, somehow, the acorns kept ending up in her mouth. Also, in  her heart of hearts, she knew that even the juggling would not be enough. People  didn't say 'pigs might juggle' when they heard of something highly unlikely, it was  always  'pigs might fly'. This was why the cannon had been spectacular. Flying was the only  thing that would do.  Trying to fly in the middle of the wood seemed like a bad idea - too easy to hit a tree.  So the piglet travelled further than she ever had before. She found a place at the edge  of the wood, where a huge meadow sloped gently downwards from the treeline.  There was nothing to hit here and it would be a nice soft landing on the thick, long  grass. Still, the piglet was nothing if not safety conscious. She made herself a little  crash helmet, woven from twigs and packed on the inside with moss. Then she set her mind to figuring out how she would launch herself.  First she found an old hollow log, which looked very much like her cannon. With  great difficulty she rolled it to the edge of the wood, pointed it towards the meadow  and raised up the end with some stones. When all was prepared, she clambered inside - bottom first - and wriggled her way down. She was very excited, waiting there in  the gloom for the cannon to fire. Of course, nothing happened. She tried counting  down - “three ... two ... one ...”. Nothing happened.  “BOOM!” she shouted.  Nothing happened.  After nothing had been happening for quite a long time, the piglet wriggled back out  of the log and stood, staring at her failed creation. It had always been the operator  who had made the cannon fire, and the piglet had always been inside while he did his  work. She had no idea what she might be missing. Looking up to the heavens in  despair, she saw a squirrel running along a branch. As it got close to the end, the  branch bent slightly. Then the squirrel jumped to the next tree and the branch sprang  back. The piglet had an idea.  It took ages for her to build her catapult. There were so many things to figure out - a  surprising number of things for something so simple. Then there was the testing.  Obviously she didn’t try it out herself. No, she found a log that was about her weight  and shape, and she tried it with that instead. The first few tests were not good.  Enough to say that the first log did not survive. In fact, it was the third log that made  the first successful flight, and that was many days later. The piglet now desperately  wanted to try the device herself, but it was late in the day, and she sensibly decided to have a good night’s sleep before the first ‘live’ test.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job The next morning she was up at dawn, checking all the different bits of her creation.  Finally, satisfied that everything was in order, she hauled back the branch that formed the main part of the catapult until she heard the click of the catch that would hold it in place while she got into position. On went the crash helmet, and then she climbed  aboard, settling into the cradle she had made at the end of the branch. With  everything ready, it would just take a swipe of her trotter to release the catch. Now,  however, she hesitated, suddenly afraid. She thought of how much she wanted to go  back to the circus, closed her eyes, counted down, knocked the catch open and ... she  was flying. The piglet opened her eyes, saw the ground rushing up to meet her, and  closed them again. Seconds later she crashed down into the meadow grass. A little  winded, maybe a little bruised, but not badly hurt ... yet. Because the ride was not  over. Although the piglet had landed, she had not stopped moving. She was rolling  down the grassy slope, unable to stop herself and beginning to feel quite sick. With a  huge effort, she twisted round so that now she wasn’t rolling, she was skidding on her bottom, but she was still going too fast. She felt herself tipping forwards, lost her  balance, flipped over in a cartwheel of trotters and - BANG - her head hit something  hard.  Now she had come to a complete stop, a little more than halfway down the slope. Her helmet, which had been smashed into pieces, fell to the ground around her. Yet when  her vision had cleared, she found herself looking down at an empty meadow. She  looked all around, but could see no obstacles of any sort, only grass. What had she hit that was so hard? The piglet stared down the slope again and blinked hard. There, less than a foot away from her snout, was a crack. A little, jagged crack just hanging in  the air. A crack where there was nothing to be cracked. As the piglet watched, the  crack grew, it branched, it spread. Very soon there was a whole section of the air,  about half a meter wide and reaching from the piglet’s snout to the ground, that was  criss-crossed with cracks. Then, suddenly, it shattered, all the little bits landing on the grass. The piglet went to touch one, but before she could, it - and all the others -  seemed to melt away into the ground. All that was left was a small, square hole. A  hole that stood, impossibly, in nothing but air.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Chapter 3: The Tunnel  The piglet, of course, was frightened. It was also true to say that she was not a very  brave piglet. However, something like this could not simply be ignored. It could not  go uninvestigated. The question of what might be found on the other side of this hole  had to be answered. Knowing that sooner or later she would have to find the courage  to go through the hole, the piglet decided that it would be best done now. She might  not have been very brave, but she was certainly no coward, and she could be quite  determined when it was necessary. Taking a deep breath, and ignoring all the excuses she had already dreamt up for delaying her exploration, she stuck her head into the  hole.  It was dark on the other side, but not pitch black. Once the piglet's eyes had adjusted  from the bright sunlight of the meadow, she found that she could see perfectly well.  She was looking into a large tunnel – a wide corridor, almost - that seemed to be  made out of iron. The hole she had made was in one side of the tunnel, close to the  floor. The other side was opposite her, about an acorn's throw away. To her left and  right, the tunnel stretched out, curving slightly, so that the ends could not be seen.  The light, she now realised, came from a number of glowing ovals, which were fixed  at regular intervals to the ceiling. The piglet pulled her head out of the hole and  looked down the slope. There was the meadow. She put her head into the hole again.  There was the tunnel. The tunnel and the meadow seemed to be in exactly the same  place, except that the meadow was sloping while the tunnel was flat. It was all very  confusing. Taking her head back out of the hole, the piglet reached out carefully with  her trotter, waving it through the air just to one side of the hole. It didn't look as  though anything was there, but nevertheless her trotter touched something hard. She  tried in several more places, each time with the same result. There was some kind of  invisible barrier across the meadow. It felt smooth, like glass, and there was no way  of knowing how far it stretched. Once again it was clear what must be done. The  piglet summoned up her courage for a second time and stepped through the hole.  The tunnel seemed larger, now that she was in the middle of it. The floor was very  flat and, aside from a thin layer of dust, seemed quite clear and clean. The walls rose  straight up on either side, before curving over to meet in an arch - high above her  head. In the circus there had been a man who walked on stilts, and the piglet thought  that even he could have walked upright in here, so high was the ceiling. Pausing for a  moment, the piglet considered which way she would go. She also, briefly, thought  about how she would find her way back, but the tunnel only went one way and the  hole, through which light was streaming, was quite obvious. So off she went, turning  to the right and trotting down the middle of the tunnel, her bright little eyes scanning  the way ahead for anything of interest and her heart beating only slightly faster than it should have done.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job It wasn't long before she started to find interesting things. First there was an empty  glass bottle, just like the circus people had, but of a much higher quality – with  thinner, smoother and more transparent glass. Then there was a metal can. Then some kind of metal tool, like the big spanners the workmen used when putting up the big  top. Although these things suggested that  there had once been people here – and there might still be – this didn't worry the  piglet as much as it should have done. Maybe it was the long-disused feel of the  place, but the further she went, the more confident she grew ... and then she saw the  door.  As she had walked, the tunnel had continued to curve round, always to the left, so she had started to think of the left hand wall as the 'inside'. The other wall, the one in  which she had made the hole, was the 'outside' wall. This door, then, was doubly  interesting because it stood in the inside wall. Otherwise it was quite unremarkable.  About the right size for a normal person, it was made of metal and had a handle about half way up. The dust around the door was just as thick as everywhere else, so it  looked like it hadn't been used recently. Putting her head against it, the piglet gave a  little shove. The door felt quite solid and immovable. She stood on her hind legs to  try and reach the handle, but it was too high. She sat down and gave the door a hard  stare. Then she looked further on down the tunnel, which continued to curve away  out of sight. Opening the door would need tools, exploring further would require  provisions, and for both of these she would have to return to the wood.  As she had not gone far, it did not take long to return to the hole. The fact that her  trotters had made such an obvious track in the dust made her more confident still, and she decided to investigate the tunnel fully before trying to open the door. It was  clearly a very long time since anyone had been in the tunnel because, apart from  where she had been, the carpet of dust was quite undisturbed.  An hour or so later, after a big lunch and with a pouch full of acorns hung around her  neck, the piglet arrived back at the tunnel. The hole was quite difficult to see from the outside, but not impossible, and the little pig decided that she would have to do  something to hide it properly. Although she had seen no people around here, it was  always better to be safe than sorry. However, this would have to wait until after her  full exploration of the tunnel. So, full of excitement and expectation, she headed in.  Unfortunately - or fortunately, depending on your viewpoint - the tunnel turned out to be rather dull. It was only the fact that it was exceptionally long that gave the piglet  any difficulties at all. When she first set off, she was very alert and inquisitive,  making note of every new thing that she found or passed. It soon became clear,  however, that the features of the tunnel were very repetitive. There were no branches  or turnings. The curve continued, always exactly the same in front as it was behind.  There were even other doors, identical to the first one, none of which could be  PagePiglet Gets A New Job opened. The only things that were not regular were the occasional items abandoned  on the floor - bottles, cans, packages (empty), bits of string or rope, odd looking  materials and even some pieces of clothing. The piglet concluded that the workmen  who had built the tunnel had simply not cleaned up properly after themselves, and  that no one else had ever bothered to come here. Why they had built such an immense tunnel in the first place was another question. By the time she reached the fifth door,  it seemed to the piglet that she had been travelling for hours, and she was very tired.  Sitting down, she ate a few acorns and then fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.  How long she slept was impossible to tell. The lamps on the ceiling shone with the  same yellow light as they had when she had closed her eyes. Only her hunger made  her think that she had slept for a long time. Eating some more acorns, she noted that  there was, perhaps, one more meal left in her pouch. Now there was a decision to  make. Whether to turn around and leave the rest of the tunnel unexplored, or to press  on and risk running out of food. Cautious by nature, the  piglet would have turned back, but she had become convinced that the tunnel went  round in an enormous circle. So she carried on, finishing the last of her acorns when  she reached the tenth door. This made her a little nervous, but at least it meant that  she could use her pouch for carrying some of the more useful bits and pieces she  found along the way.  By the time she passed the twelfth door, she was getting hungry again, and very tired. The thought of the long journey back the way she had come, with no food, was an  alarming one. So it was a greatly relieved piglet who saw sunlight shining into the  tunnel ahead. It had taken well over a day, but she had completed her exploration.  Next she would have to find a way to get through that first door.  The following day, however, the piglet was too tired and sore to attempt the door.  When she wasn’t dozing, she spent her time stocking up on acorns and making it  harder for any passers-by to see the hole. By banking up some earth and carefully  replanting some tall grasses, she managed to cover the hole, while still making it easy to get in and out. Having determined that the tunnel was deserted, she now felt even  safer in there than in the wood. So much so that she chose to sleep in the tunnel  overnight. True, it was annoying that the lights never went out, but they were dim  enough to be ignored and safety came first in the little pig’s opinion. She had always  been worried, on the outside, that she might be surprised in her sleep and, therefore,  captured. Now she had found the best hiding place of all and so, despite the light, she  slept soundly.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Chapter 4: The Town  The opening of the door had gone well. Not perfectly, because her first idea - to loop  a piece of string around the handle and pull it down – had been a frustrating failure.  First, she spent ages trying to throw the string over the handle. Then, when she pulled down, she found that the string always slipped off before the handle moved enough to open the door. After a few attempts she gave up in favour of a much simpler plan.  Bringing stones, logs and earth from outside, she built a platform beside the door. It  took a long time, but once it was done the platform looked very solid, and the piglet  was proud of the results of her hard work. Wasting no time, she hopped onto the new  platform, stood up on her hind legs and pulled down on the door handle with her  trotter. At first it was very stiff, then suddenly, the handle moved. There was a soft  click and the door swung partly open, almost causing the piglet to fall off her  platform. Instead she dropped back onto all fours, hopped down to the dusty floor and pushed her snout through the gap in the door.  Rather surprisingly, she found herself facing a bush. Pushing forward, and widening  the gap in the door so it was big enough for her whole body, the piglet tried to see  what was beyond the bush. Without going all the way through and risking the door  swinging shut, trapping her, it was difficult to guess anything about her surroundings. Some things, however, were clear. On this side of the door, the sun was shining - just  as it had been in the meadow - and the air smelt fresh after the closed air of the  tunnel, which had a metallic taint to it. Also, as the breeze ruffled the leaves of the  bush, glimpses of a wide open space, and of buildings beyond that, could be seen.  The piglet felt no fear, peering into this new and strange place. Quite the opposite in  fact. As she stood, half in and half out of the doorway, a feeling of great calm and,  yes, almost happiness had come over her. However, buildings meant people, and  people meant danger. So, cautious as ever, she retreated through the door, closing it  behind her, so she could plan her next move.  The planning did not take long. Just like the tunnel, this new oddity had to be  explored and similar preparations were required. There was one major change. This  time the piglet judged that the exploration should be done at night, when she would  have the best chance of hiding from any people she might meet. So, having had an  afternoon nap, she found herself back at the door - or rather, halfway through it.  There was a pouch of acorns round her neck and she also carried a small branch. She  waited until the twilight faded and, with the landscape bathed in the silvery light of a  crescent moon, she squeezed through the door - leaving it, prudently, wedged open  with one of the metal tools from the tunnel. Now she crept round to the front of the  bush, dropping the branch there as a marker for when she came back, and turned to  have her first proper look at this new place.  It really was quite beautiful. Immediately in front of her lay a stretch of parkland, the  PagePiglet Gets A New Job like of which she had never seen before. There were trees and bushes, patches of  flowers and large stretches of immaculately kept lawn. The colours of the flowers  were hidden by the moonlight, but their scent was not, seeming all the more powerful in the stillness of the night. Beyond the park lay what looked like a town. The  buildings were neat and pretty, and they stood in an orderly fashion along wide  streets. The town, but not the parkland, was lit by the same glowing  ovals that lit the tunnel. Except here there was no ceiling, so they were fixed, instead,  high up on the buildings. The piglet trotted carefully across the grass towards the  town. As an afterthought, she turned to see if the door was well hidden by the bush.  To her amazement, looking back the way she had come, all she could see was the  parkland continuing into the distance. It must be the same illusion that was used to  hide the outside, she thought. Fortunately, she was able to identify the right bush  because of the branch she had dropped in front of it. In the darkness, there was no  sign of the open door, so she turned back to the town and continued onwards.  The town was very large. The piglet walked down many streets, gazing at the elegant  and colourful buildings, trying to guess what they all were. Some were obviously  shops, the things they had for sale being prominently displayed in big glass windows. Some seemed to be houses, but even the smallest ones looked grand compared to the  poshest homes in the towns that the circus had visited. Finally there were some  buildings on such an enormous scale that the piglet could not begin to guess what  they might be used for. There was a collection of these larger buildings around a  spacious square, which might have been at the centre of the town. In the middle of  the square was a tree that dripped sparkling silvery light from its many branches. It  was quite the most beautiful thing that the piglet had ever seen, and she stared at the  tree for a long time before turning and heading back to the park. The town had been  amazing, but also a disappointment.  While the piglet still felt a deep distrust of people, following the clown’s harsh words and the children’s attempt to catch her, she also had a need for companionship. Until  yesterday she had thought that the only place she could be truly happy was the circus, but when she first glimpsed the secret town, and felt the wave of calmness and  contentment wash over her, she began to hope for something even better. If only  there were people here who were as kind as the parkland was beautiful, as gentle as  the buildings were impressive. Maybe, and here the piglet showed that her  imagination still suffered from some limits, maybe, she had thought, they might even  have a slightly larger cannon.  Her nocturnal search, however, had dashed these young hopes. There was not a sign  of a person anywhere in the town. Sniffing the air with her sensitive nose, the piglet  could not catch the scent of any other creature in the streets she visited. Despite the  seeming order of the place and the strange impression it gave of being well looked  after, the only conclusion that the piglet could draw was that the town was as deserted PagePiglet Gets A New Job as the tunnel. Yet she did not despair. Although there was no one around at night,  there was a slim possibility that she would find someone if she returned during the  day. So she headed back to the tunnel, carefully securing the door behind her, intent  on catching a few hours’ sleep before resuming her explorations in the morning.  Of course the town was not deserted, and the streets of a big town are never entirely  quiet, even at night. Several people saw the little pig as she wandered along on her  exploration. They smiled to themselves, or winked at one another as she trotted past,  but otherwise they left her alone. There was even a little boy, awake long after his  bedtime, who saw her from his bedroom window. He hoped that she would come  back so that they could play together, and with these pleasant thoughts going round in his head, he fell asleep.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Chapter 5: The People  It was late in the morning by the time the piglet woke up, following her long night of  exploration. Everything in the town was hustle and bustle. Shops were open, people  were going about their business and some, like the little boy and his mother, were  lucky enough to have time to spend in the beautiful park. The boy saw the piglet as  soon as she emerged from behind the bush, and he let out a squeal of delight.  ""Mama, Mama, look! It's the pig I saw last night,"" he said, ""do you think he's come  back to play with me?""  His mother looked up from her reading and cast a practiced eye over the object of her son's attention.  ""That is a piglet, not a pig,"" she said, kindly but sternly, ""and it is a little girl, not a  'he'.""  ""Why won't she play with me, Mama?"" persisted the boy, tottering along beside the  trotting piglet.  ""She doesn't see you, darling,"" replied his mother, ""now come back here and leave  her alone, please.""  The little boy toddled back to his mother, a tiny bit disappointed, but still excited and  full of questions.  ""Why can't she see me, Mama? Have I gone invisible?""  ""It's not that she can't see us,"" explained the mother, ""it's more that she's just not  ready to see us yet. And it's not just you, it's everyone. Look, see how she walks  down the street like she's the only person in town.""  Sure enough, from the piglet's point of view, the town seemed just as deserted as it  had been the night before. How it was that she didn't bump into anyone, or notice the  doors of the shops opening and closing, or smell any of the delicious food in the cafes was a mystery. Except to the townspeople. They had seen people arrive from the  outside before – very infrequently – and it always happened the same. At first they  could see nothing. Sometimes they would simply turn around and leave, never to  return. Sometimes they were the 'wrong sort' and had to be made to forget.  Sometimes, but not often at all, they would see for themselves and for the right  reasons, then they were allowed to stay.  “That one seems like one of the good ones,” said the mother, “I’m sure she will see  us when she really needs to.”  But by this time the little boy had grown bored by the conversation. He was far away, chasing a butterfly across the lawn.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job While the little boy played, the piglet searched all around the town. Long after the  boy had been taken home for his nap, she returned to the park, foot-sore and  miserable. A few times she  was sure that she had seen someone, and her heart had leapt, but when she turned it  had just been shadows. If it hadn’t been for the oddly calming effect of the place, she  might well have burst into tears there and then. As it was, the tears didn’t come until  she had passed through the tunnel and emerged back into the meadow. It was so  unfair to have made such an amazing discovery and yet not to have benefited from it.  Now there was no hope. No way back to the circus and no miracle to save her. She  would be alone forever, just her and the wood.  It was in this same mood of self-pity and despair that the piglet spent the next few  days. Each morning she would go out into the wood to root around for food, or just to mope about and curse her bad luck. Each evening she would return to the tunnel to  sleep. Sometimes, in the night, she would get up and go into the park to smell the  flowers, or go to the town square to gaze at the beautiful tree. These things would  always make her feel a little better, but then she would remind herself of all her bad  luck - all the injustice she had suffered - and her heart would harden. On one of these  trips, the little boy’s mother almost tripped over her. The mother had been visiting a  friend and was in a happy mood, but that changed when she saw the piglet. ‘Oh dear,’ she thought, ‘that one was so close to seeing when she first arrived, but now she is  further away than ever. My son will be very sad.’  A couple of days after this, as had become inevitable because of her sullen mood, the  piglet made a mistake. Foraging in the wood, her sensitive nose picked up a most  delicious scent. It was the smell of every pig’s favourite of favourite foods - a truffle.  Unmindful of anything else, she hunted round and round for the right place, then  began to dig with her trotters and snout - delving down towards this rare delicacy.  She was so absorbed in this task that she didn’t notice the two men until they were  almost upon her. If one of them hadn’t stepped on a twig she might have ended up in  a cooking pot, but the loud snap brought her back to full alertness. In less than half a  second, realising her terrible peril, she was off and running.  “Get it!” shouted one of the men, and she heard the sound of heavy footfalls as the  two pursued her.  “Shoot, before it gets away,” shouted the other.  The piglet sped on, weaving through the trees as an arrow whizzed past, an inch  above her head. Now she was heading for the meadow and for the safest place she  knew. Breaking clear of the trees, she rocketed down the slope. It was so close that  she was sure she was going to make it, but then there was a terrible pain in her  haunch. Bright lights of agony blocked her vision and she tumbled, snout over  trotters, through the hole.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Lying there, in the dull yellow light, she could see the arrow sticking out just above  her right hind leg. She tried to stand and almost squealed out loud in pain. She was  glad she didn’t because the next thing she heard was a man’s voice, right outside the  hole.  “I’m sure I hit her, she can’t have gone far.”  “The only shot I saw went wide,” said the other man, breathing heavily.  “That’s because you were so far behind, you fat fool,” said the first, “if you hadn’t  trodden on that twig we’d have had it with no fuss. Now help me look, I’m sure it’s  hiding here somewhere.”  With the search so close, the piglet couldn’t stay where she was. Gritting her teeth,  she hobbled along the tunnel on her three good legs. It seemed to take an age to get to the door and  an impossible effort to get it open. Yet, somehow, she found herself crawling across  the park, dimly aware that she was leaving an ugly streak of red blood on the  manicured lawn. She was so tired, but before she slept, she badly wanted to see the  beautiful tree again. Now the piglet realised how foolish she had been, to have had  something so marvellous in her life and still to have thought herself unlucky. So, on  she crawled. She was very determined, but it was such a long way and she was so  tired. Maybe a little sleep would give her the strength to finish the journey.  Just before her eyes closed, the piglet was jolted awake. Gentle hands were lifting her and kind faces were all around. She looked down and saw a little boy staring up at  her with a solemn, concerned expression.  “Is she going to be okay, Mama?” he asked. “Yes, dear. They’re going to take her to  a doctor. She’ll be fine,” came the reply.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Chapter 6: The New Job  And so it was that, in her most desperate need, the piglet was able to see the friends  who had been hidden from her for so long ... but what of her new job?  After a few days, when the doctor had said it was alright to be up and about, the  town’s mayor came to see the piglet. They went for a little walk - a good thing to do,  the doctor said, as long as they didn’t go too far - and as they walked, they talked.  “We shall find you somewhere to live, of course,” the mayor had said, “and have you  had time to think about what you might like to do for work?”  The piglet stopped dead in her tracks.  “I can walk on two legs, and I can juggle a little,” she said in a small voice, not  daring to look at the mayor.  “Well, those sound like excellent skills,” said the mayor, “but not what I’d really call  work.”  The piglet felt her stomach twist into a hard knot.  “If I’m not able to find something useful to do, will I have to leave?” she asked,  looking up at the mayor.  The expression on her face - such a mixture of concern, fear, sadness and resignation  - was so comical in its exaggeration that the mayor burst out laughing. Then he  realised how serious the piglet was being.  “You never have to leave,” he said, gently and sincerely, “you’re part of the town  now. I just asked because most people round here like to work, and it’s good to do  work that you enjoy.”  A wave of relief flooded over the piglet, and she smiled up at the mayor. Then she  grew more serious as she thought about what he had said.  “I’ve never really done work before,” she said, thinking now that being fired out of a  cannon probably didn’t count, “I’m not sure what I’d enjoy.”  “There’s no rush,” said the mayor, smiling back at her, “take your time. Find out  what other people do. Try a few things. My only advice is that people often enjoy  doing something that they’re good at.”  “Okay,” said the piglet, solemnly, “I’ll think about it.”  They walked on in silence for a while, each with their own thoughts, then the piglet  came to a sudden halt outside a bakery.  “I do have a very good nose,” said the piglet, thoughtfully. “Really,” said the mayor,  “tell me, what can you smell right now?”  PagePiglet Gets A New Job The piglet sniffed the air. Once, twice, three times. She sniffed high. She sniffed low.  She sniffed left and right.  “I can smell the flowers in the park,” she said, “and I can smell some strawberries in  the bakery - the baker should use them today because they will go bad tomorrow.  Then there’s a smell I don’t know, but it seems ... wrong ... evil, almost.”  She dropped her snout and sniffed her way along the street. When she got to a certain spot, she turned in a little circle, her snout brushing the ground. When she was  satisfied, she looked up at the mayor.  “I don’t know exactly what it is,” she said, “but I’m absolutely certain that there’s  something broken right under this very spot.""  Men were called. They arrived with all sorts of impressive looking instruments, and  they wore blue overalls. Lifting a manhole cover a little way down the street, they  disappeared inside. Emerging a little while later, they gathered in a group, talking  excitedly and, every now and then, glancing at the piglet. The town’s chief engineer  then arrived. He was not wearing blue overalls, but he went down under the street  nevertheless. When he came back up, the other men gathered around him, and they  seemed to be arguing. Eventually the mayor decided to interrupt. Telling the piglet to  follow, he strode up to the group of engineers.  “What is it?” he asked, “What have you found?”  “There was a fault in the power grid,” said the chief engineer, “It was only a minor  fault, but if it hadn’t been found, it could have been dangerous - there could even  have been an explosion.”  “Could you have detected it with your instruments?” asked the mayor. The engineers  shuffled their feet a little. “No, not from the surface,” admitted the chief engineer.  “So how was this little pig able to find it?”  “That’s what we were arguing about,” said one of the engineers, “we don’t think that  the power grid even has a smell.”  “It does,” broke in the piglet, “it smells like hot metal on a cold day.”  Everyone stared at her.  “Little pig,” said the chief engineer, after a few seconds, “do you think you could  help me and my team find other faults?”  From that day on, the piglet worked as one of the town’s engineers. She toured the  streets, sniffing out faults, and sometimes her sensitive nose would sniff out other  things as well - like lost belongings. She was good at her work, and she enjoyed it.  She also made lots of friends, but none better than the little boy, and they played  together every day.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Zeus did the only thing that he could, faced with this prophesy that foretold his  certain death, he cheated. In disguise, he made his way to the palace of the king and  queen of Thebes, one of the great cities of Ancient Greece. On the very night he  arrived, the queen gave birth. A prince, it was said, who would be heir to his father’s  throne. Waiting until the celebrations had died down and the palace was quiet, Zeus  crept into the nursery. To his dismay, he found that there was not one, but two babies. Both baby boys. How would he decide between the two? Which one would grow up  to be his champion? While he was stood looking in confusion from one cradle to the  other, there was a noise from outside – a crow cawing in the night. The babies woke,  and while one set up a wailing fit to wake the palace, the other smiled at Zeus and  reached out his little arms towards the god. This was enough. Moving quickly but  calmly, Zeus placed his hand on the baby’s head and chanted several powerful spells. Then he fed to the baby a spoonful of ambrosia, the special food of the gods. By the  time the nurse, woken by the wailing, had entered the nursery, Zeus had disappeared  out of the window and was on his way back to Olympus.  Hercules was the son of a king and queen, raised as a prince and trained to rule over  the people when the time came for him to take the throne, but Zeus also looked on  him as a son, watched over him and visited often – always in disguise. By the time  news of the giants’ revolt reached the palace high on Olympus, Hercules had grown  into a fine young man, skilled in the use of all the weapons of war – especially the  bow – but equally at home plucking the strings of a lyre. It was true that some found  him proud, with a quick temper that often burst like a storm over some unlucky  servant, but he was a prince – this kind of behaviour was to be expected. Naturally,  the young Hercules felt himself destined for greater things than merely ruling a Greek city state. So, when Zeus finally revealed himself and asked for help in defeating the  giants, Hercules did not think to consider himself lucky to have been chosen. Rather  he considered that this was the natural order of things – that it was inevitable.  During the years of Hercules’ childhood, Zeus had not been idle. Cronos had  mentioned that the giants would have only one weakness, so Zeus had searched far  and wide for anyone who might know what this was. Finally, from the far north,  whispered stories came to Zeus’ ear. Stories about a special herb that, used in the  right way, would stop the giants in their tracks. He dispatched sharp-eyed eagles,  swift winged swallows and birds of all types to search the air and the earth for any  sign of this herb. Poseidon sent his subjects to search all the corners of his kingdom  under the waves, and Hades released the demons of Tartarus to travel all the  passageways of the underworld. All this activity brought no result, and the giants  came ever closer to Olympus. When it became clear that the mountain would soon be surrounded, Zeus knew he must fetch Hercules, his champion, before it was too late.  When they returned together to Olympus, there was no word – the herb had not been  found – and the giants were approaching.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Zeus and Hercules entered the palace just as Ares, the god of war, was addressing the other gods, who had gathered in a disorderly council.  “The enemy is at our walls,” he said, “Even now they gather on the hilltops around,  preparing to hurl fire and rock against us. We must go out to meet them in battle.”  Now he drew his sword and raised his shield, his voice ringing in the large hall.  “Let us show these giants what it is to suffer the anger of the gods!”  Hercules was greatly impressed by this speech and by the fine figure of Ares in his  full battle armour. Zeus, however, had a wiser head on his shoulders.  “The giants cannot hurt us with their sticks and stones,” said Zeus, “you will see that  the walls of Olympus are stronger than they look. Yet, as we stand today, we cannot  harm the giants. We have one half of the cure, but not the other.”  Now all eyes were on Hercules. He was no stranger to the members of the council,  they had each visited him many times during his childhood with lessons, or help in  time of need. Now, each of them hoped that they had done enough to prepare this  man for the superhuman task he must perform. Hercules, for his part, showed no  surprise at seeing childhood teachers and friends now revealed as gods – for, of  course, they had always made their visits to him in disguise. He simply unslung his  bow and his club, and prepare to speak.  “Even though we do not have the herb,” he said, addressing the room, “I cannot  believe that such a company as this will ever know defeat, but if I am wrong, I can  think of no greater honour than to fight and die as one of your number.”  The gods cheered this noble speech, raising such a noise that no-one noticed the eagle until it landed on Zeus’ arm.  So it was that Hercules was sent to harvest the herb. Hermes, the messenger of the  gods, lent him winged sandals, so that he could fly. Then, the eagle guided him to the  desolate island where the herb grew. There was such a small amount, but Hercules  harvested every last morsel, before heading back. Although it seemed to Hercules  that he had not been away for long, when he returned to Olympus the situation had  changed dramatically for the worse. So, he was faced with his choice – where to join  the fight. How to help the gods, who were slowly but surely being pressed back  towards their palace, and how to use the herb.  First he tried rubbing the herb on his weapons, but although he scored many direct  hits on the giants, any he knocked down were soon up again to rejoin the fight. After  this, he tried everything else he could think of. He rubbed the herb on himself, on the  giants and on one or two of the gods. No effect. He tried chewing a tiny piece, then  he knocked down a giant and put some in its mouth. Nothing. He even tried wearing  some in his hair. The only thing that changed was that he had less and less of the  precious herb left, and there was no way to get more. His patience was exhausted.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job The gods were fighting in a tight ring around the top of Mount Olympus, and they  were tiring. Hercules saw Ares smashed to the ground by one giant, barely  scrambling away in time to avoid its clutches. He glowered at a piece of the herb,  which he held between his thumb and forefinger, as if it were deliberately trying to  trick him.  “What use are you?” he shouted at the small green stalk, “Why was I sent to the ends  of the earth for you when you do nothing?”  As Hercules shouted, his knuckles grew white and his hand shook as his tremendous  strength was applied to this one tiny thing he held. It was too much, and with a  popping sound that seemed too loud for the size of the leaf, the herb was crushed to  dust. Hercules recoiled as a thin trail of smoke curled up from between his fingers,  where the herb had been moments earlier. Even at arm’s length, the smell of this was  overpowering. Hercules felt his head spin and his limbs lock in place. Clamping his  mouth shut, he held his breath, watching the smoke waver and dissolve into the air.  Now he knew the secret, but there was so little of the herb left – he wondered if it  would be enough.  The sound of cruel laughter from nearby made him put these thoughts aside. One of  the giants had grabbed the goddess Athene and was crushing her in a bear hug. The  other gods would have rushed to her aid, but they were too busy fighting for their  own lives. Hercules realised that this was now down to him, that he would have to  beat this giant – and many more like it – but not a flicker of doubt crossed his mind.  He raced over and, jumping high into the air, landed a terrific blow on the side of the  giant’s head. Surprised and dizzy, the giant dropped Athene, who fell to the ground  and stood gasping for breath. Now Hercules swept his club at the giant’s legs,  catching it just above the ankles and sending it crashing to the ground. Running up  the giant’s body, Hercules grasped a morsel of the herb, as before, between his thumb and forefinger. With all his might he squeezed, popping the herb right under the  giant’s nose, while being careful to hold his own breath. The giant’s face registered a  moment of surprise, then of disgust at the vile stench, then it froze. A milky greyness  flowed along its enormous body, from the head to the toes and fingers. When it was  finished, Hercules found himself standing, not on a giant, but on a piece of rock. The  giant had been turned to stone and would, now and forever, be a part of the mountain. Athene, who had seen the transformation, directed Hercules to other parts of the  fight. One by one, and working with the other gods and goddesses, they disabled the  giants long enough for Hercules to use the herb and turn them to stone. With each  giant that was defeated the work grew easier, until all the gods together faced just one remaining enemy, the leader of the giants – Alcyoneus. Although he was  outnumbered, he was in no mood to give in. Twice as big as any of the other giants,  Alcyoneus fought ferociously - sometimes even driving the gods back. Finally  Hercules and Artemis, working together, pinned him down with a shower of arrows.  PagePiglet Gets A New Job Then Zeus blasted Alcyoneus to the ground with a thunderbolt. Victory in sight,  Hercules ran up to the giant’s huge head and ... nothing. The herb had run out. There  was none left, and now there was no way on earth to defeat Alcyoneus.

Everybody knows that.”  The elephant burped.At school, the teacher grumbled, “What’s  wrong with this chalkboard? It’s all wrinkly!” “That’s not the chalkboard. That’s my  elephant!” said Lindi.  “There are no elephants at school,” said  the teacher. “Everybody knows that.”  The elephant ate the teacher’s sandwiches.At break-time, the elephant followed Lindi  to the playground.

FKB-Stories-Little-Red-Riding-Hood.txt,"Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her. It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, ""Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill. Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter."" Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest. He asked her where she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and talk to a wolf, said to him, ""I am going to see my grandmother and carry her a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother.""""Does she live far off?"" said the wolf ""Oh I say,"" answered Little Red Riding Hood; ""it is beyond that mill you see there, at the frst house in the village."" ""Well,"" said the wolf, ""and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and go you that, and we shall see who will be there frst."" The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterfies, and gathering bouquets of little fowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap. ""Who's there?"" ""Your grandchild, Little Red Riding Hood,"" replied the wolf, counterfeiting her voice; ""who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter sent you by mother."" The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, ""Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."" The wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap. ""Who's there?"" Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at frst afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, ""It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you."" The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, ""Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."" Little Red Riding Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened. The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, ""Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come get into bed with me.""Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes and got into bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her nightclothes, and said to her, ""Grandmother, what big arms you have!"" ""All the better to hug you with, my dear."" ""Grandmother, what big legs you have!"" ""All the better to run with, my child."" ""Grandmother, what big ears you have!"" ""All the better to hear with, my child."" ""Grandmother, what big eyes you have!"" ""All the better to see with, my child."" ""Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!"" ""All the better to eat you up with."" And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.Moral:  Children should never talk to strangers, for if they should do so, they may well provide dinner for a wolf.  I say ""wolf,"" but there are various kinds of wolves. There are also those who are charming, quiet, polite, unassuming, complacent, and sweet, who pursue young children at home and in the streets. And unfortunately, it is these gentle strangers and sometimes friends who are the most dangerous ones of all. If you should ever see someone you are scared of tell an adult you trust straight away.   ","The story Little Red Riding Hood tells the tale of a young girl who sets out to visit her grandmother, carrying a cake and a pot of butter from her mother. Along the way, she meets a wolf who convinces her to take a longer route while he takes a shorter one, so they can see who arrives first. The wolf goes to the grandmother's house and eats her up, then disguises himself as the grandmother in bed. When Little Red Riding Hood arrives, he tricks her into getting into bed with him, then eats her up too. The moral of the story is that children should never talk to strangers because they might end up becoming a meal for a wolf.","['wolf', 'grandmother', 'mother', 'creature', 'grandchild']"

The-I-forgot-Kid-FKB.txt,"BEING PICKED All day in class I couldn't sit still. I was so excited. I just couldn't wait to tell everyone. My teacher had picked ME! Out of all the class, I was the one selected to read a prayer at the big assembly. It would be the frst time I'd ever stood up in front of the whole school – grades one through eight. For a frst grader, that seemed pretty darn cool. Was I scared? No. I was thrilled! I knew if I practiced really hard I would say my lines like a star. I would make my teacher and parents proud. Just one short sentence – that's all I had to memorize, just two lines.  I was going to say the sentence every day till I knew it forward and backward,  there would be no chance of failure. My teacher believed in me, and I wanted to show her I was worthy, that she made the right choice. LEARNING MY LINES Every morning I said my lines. Before breakfast, after breakfast, in the car on the way to school. Every afternoon, I said them again. Before dinner, after dinner, then once more before bed for luck. My brother made su re I knew everyone was getting way sick of hearing my lines by now, but hey, this was an important job, I was not put off!  Counting down the days and counting my mistakes – Last two days, mistakes: none!  Dad teased me that I would be saying the prayer in my sleep. THE BIG DAY Entering the school assembly, it looked just like I imagined, the huge familiar hall, the whole school there. But I wasn't scared. I  enjoyed my time to shine.  I waited for my turn with the other two student speakers. The children came from different grades, one student fr om each school division picked, I'd been selected for the whole of lower primary. After what seemed like an eternity, I followed the cue, stepped toward the principal who held out the microphone for me, and glanced out at the crowd. GONE Without notice, -ZAP- my head went totally blank.  Where were my lines? How, why, where? It was so important to me, I knew what to say, but I didn't –  I was terrifed, panic started to build up inside me.  Looking out and around me again, the audience staring back, my head felt like an empty scrapbook pages from art class.  – My mind became frantic, but nothing came.  The principal spoke to me, handed me the microphone, it was my time to speak. Yet, I had no words. A rush of the last week's work few through my mind, all the practice, the paper with the lines, the words, but they were just not there.  I had to say something – the microphone in front of me, the audience waiting, expecting.... The principal said my name again; patient but impatient all at once. All I could stammer was “Um.....I forgot.”   The hall fell into silence. Then uncomfortable stifed laughter.  Then I was ushered off stage.  It was over.  Sad was an understatement. I felt like a balloon with my air let out, a gummy squashed on the pavement. But even worse than disappointing myself – and the feeling I had disappointed my teacher and parents; the fear that everyone would laugh at me.   THEY DID... And they did. Mum and Dad knew I was pretty gutted, but it was a l l b r u s h e d o f f . I t h i n k t o r e d u c e m y embarrassment. I don't think anyone knew what happened afterward, on the playground, or how badly the experience hit me. The effect would ripple increasingly outward in my heart.    For months and months, an eternity, older kids came up to me and laughed, usually the boys. Kids in my class didn't care, they understood, but the rest of the school thought it was cool to make jokes. Yep, I was now the “I-Forgot” kid. What the kids didn't understand is how deep it hurt.  I never spoke again in public until I took a position as a counsellor to help kids stop bullying. Then one day I had to face my fear. I stood up in front of a group, to say my frst words. The frst words in front of a large group in twenty years. How could I teach these kids not to do the same thing to their classmates? How could I tell them not to judge, not to laugh, to care? EPILOGUE The child in this story grew up to be a champion on behalf of those bullied or hurt. Helping students realise it's so not okay to tease. Helping kids who faltered or failed get back on the horse and try again. Helping this one school be a better place, one where all students can thrive. Where no bullying was the way of life and bullies were ridiculed. And gradually the counsellor overcame the fear to speak with practice and the reward of students growth.Can you make a difference in your school? THE END ","A first grader is thrilled to be chosen to read a prayer at a school assembly. She practices her lines diligently but forgets them when it's her turn to speak. She becomes the laughingstock of the school and feels deeply hurt. Eventually, she becomes a champion against bullying and helps students who have been hurt or failed to try again.
